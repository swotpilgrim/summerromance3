# Chapter 2: The Golden Boy

The mess hall was everything I'd feared—too many people in too small a space, all of them talking at once. Long wooden tables stretched in rows from front to back, benches packed with girls wearing eager expressions and summer dresses. Camp pennants hung from the rafters in faded glory, and a trophy case along one wall displayed decades of achievements I'd never contribute to. The whole room smelled of pine cleaner and whatever mystery casserole awaited us for dinner.

I made my way to the back row and slipped onto the end of a bench, Jane Eyre still clutched in my hand like a talisman. Girls filled in around me, but no one sat directly next to me. That was fine. Better than fine. I opened my book to the page I'd marked—Jane was about to return to Mr. Rochester, about to discover what remained after the fire—and tried to pretend I was anywhere but here.

"Is this seat taken?"

I looked up to find Betty smiling down at me. Behind her stood two other girls, both with the same friendly, open expressions that seemed to come naturally to some people.

"No." I moved my book to my lap to make room.

Betty sat, followed by her friends, and immediately launched into introductions I half-listened to while keeping my eyes on the page. Something about the girl on her left being from Ohio and loving horses. Something about the girl on her right having a brother who'd gone to the boys' camp last year. I nodded at what seemed like appropriate moments and tried to focus on Jane's words, but the noise in the mess hall made reading impossible.

At the front of the room, a woman stepped onto the small stage that probably served for announcements and camp performances. The chatter didn't die down immediately, but it quieted enough that I looked up.

Mrs. Morrison, I remembered from the welcome materials. The camp director. She looked exactly like I'd imagined—late fifties, steel-gray hair pinned in a no-nonsense bun, wearing a crisp camp uniform with a whistle on a lanyard. Her expression managed to be both stern and warm, like a grandmother who wouldn't tolerate mischief but might sneak you cookies later.

She didn't say anything. She just stood there, waiting. The silence spread through the mess hall in a wave until you could have heard a pin drop.

"Welcome to Camp Silver Lake." Her voice carried without shouting, the product of decades commanding the attention of teenage girls. "For those of you returning, welcome back. For those of you here for the first time, welcome to what I hope will become a treasured summer memory."

She launched into the orientation speech—rules about curfew, lake safety, respecting counselors, the buddy system for swimming, lights-out procedures, mail call, weekly phone call signups for emergencies only. I let the words wash over me while my mind wandered. Eight weeks of rules and schedules and forced activities. Eight weeks of pretending to be normal.

"Now," Mrs. Morrison said, "I'd like to introduce our counselor team. These young men and women are here to ensure your safety, guide your activities, and help make this summer special. When I call your name, please stand so the campers can see you."

She read from a list. "Miss Patterson, girls' cabin counselor." The woman who'd visited our cabin earlier stood and waved. Polite applause rippled through the crowd. "Mr. Davidson, boys' athletics." A stocky man in his thirties nodded seriously. More applause. "Miss Hayes, arts and crafts." A pretty brunette in her early twenties stood, smiling warmly.

The introductions continued. I should have paid attention, but I was thinking about the book in my lap, about whether I could finish Jane Eyre tonight if I read by flashlight after lights-out, about how many more hours until I could be alone again.

"And finally," Mrs. Morrison said, "returning for his third year as our waterfront director and senior swimming instructor, Mr. Michael Grant."

The applause that erupted was different from the polite clapping that had greeted the other counselors. This was enthusiastic, almost giddy. Girls around me sat up straighter, whispered to each other, craned their necks to see.

I looked up.

Michael Grant stood from where he'd been sitting at the counselors' table, and my heart did something I'd only read about in books—it actually skipped a beat. I felt it, a flutter behind my ribs that made me catch my breath.

He was tall, with an athletic build that suggested actual ability rather than just show. His hair was dark blonde, cut short in a style that was neat without being severe. But it was his face that made every girl in the room react—handsome in an approachable way, with a smile that seemed genuine rather than practiced. He wore the counselor uniform—a white t-shirt with the Camp Silver Lake logo and khaki shorts—but somehow he made it look like something from a magazine.

He waved at the crowd, looking slightly embarrassed by the enthusiastic welcome, which only made him more appealing. When he spoke, his voice was warm and friendly.

"Thanks, Mrs. Morrison. Hey, everyone. I'm looking forward to another great summer at Silver Lake. Whether you're a beginning swimmer or ready for advanced certification, we'll get you comfortable in the water. See you at the lake."

He sat back down, and the girls around me erupted into whispered commentary.

"He's even more dreamy than last year!"

"Did you see his smile?"

"I'm definitely signing up for every swimming activity."

"My sister had him as an instructor two years ago. She said he's really nice, not just good-looking."

I closed my book slowly, no longer even pretending to read. I couldn't stop looking at where Michael sat at the counselors' table, talking to Miss Hayes about something. He was beautiful in an untouchable way, like someone who'd accidentally wandered into our ordinary world from somewhere better. The kind of boy I'd read about but never imagined actually existed.

Mrs. Morrison continued with closing remarks about dinner being served in thirty minutes and tomorrow's activity fair, but I barely heard her. I was aware of a strange feeling unfurling in my chest—something warm and terrifying and completely unfamiliar.

This was what other girls talked about. This flutter, this hyperawareness, this sudden inability to think straight. I'd read about it in books, had seen it happen to friends at school, but I'd never experienced it myself. I'd always been too busy being invisible, too focused on not drawing attention, too locked in my own careful world.

But looking at Michael Grant, I felt something shift. Maybe this summer wouldn't be complete torture. Maybe having something—someone—to look at, to think about, would make the days pass faster. A crush was safe, after all. He was twenty, a counselor, completely out of reach. I could watch from a distance, let myself feel this strange new feeling, and never have to risk actual rejection because there would never be actual possibility.

The thought was comforting and sad at the same time.

Something happened then that cemented everything. A young girl—probably only thirteen, clearly a first-year camper—had been holding her orientation packet during the applause. In her excitement over Michael, she dropped it, and papers scattered across the floor at her feet. Her face flushed red as she scrambled to pick them up, and I recognized the panic in her movements. The fear of being noticed for the wrong reason, of being the girl who caused a disruption.

Michael saw it happen. He was off the stage and crouching beside her before anyone else could react, gathering papers with quick efficiency. I couldn't hear what he said to her, but I saw her face transform from embarrassment to relief to a shy smile. He handed her the reorganized packet with a grin that said "happens to everyone" and squeezed her shoulder in a brief, kind gesture before returning to his seat.

The whole interaction took maybe thirty seconds, but in those thirty seconds, I fell completely into the fantasy.

He wasn't just handsome. He was kind. Patient. The type of person who noticed when someone was embarrassed and fixed it without making them feel worse. The type of person I'd never be brave enough to talk to but could safely admire from afar.

Perfect.

Mrs. Morrison dismissed the orientation, and the mess hall erupted into motion. Girls headed for the doors in groups, discussing the counselors and tomorrow's activities and where they wanted to sit for dinner later. Betty stood with her friends, still chattering about something, but I slipped away before she could try to include me.

I needed air. Space. A moment to process this strange new feeling without an audience.

The path from the mess hall to the lake wasn't hard to find—it was the main artery of camp, worn smooth by years of feet. I followed it, leaving behind the noise and energy, letting the pine-scented air and early evening light calm the confusion in my chest.

The lake appeared through the trees like something from a postcard. It stretched wide and blue, dotted with a few canoes making their way back to the dock as the day wound down. The dock itself extended maybe thirty feet into the water, wooden planks weathered gray by sun and water. A rope marked the swimming area, and beyond that, the lake continued to the far shore where the boys' camp was supposedly located.

I walked to the end of the dock and sat down, finally alone. My feet dangled over the water, and I set Jane Eyre beside me, spine carefully placed so it wouldn't roll off into the lake. The water reflected the sky—blue deepening to gold and pink as sunset approached. A light breeze rippled the surface and stirred the pine branches behind me.

For the first time all day, I felt like I could breathe.

This was what I needed. Quiet spaces where I could sort through my thoughts, where I didn't have to pretend to be someone I wasn't. The camp was full of noise and people and expectations, but there were places like this—edges and corners where someone could hide and think and just be.

I picked up my book but didn't open it. Instead, I stared at the water and let myself think about Michael Grant. About the way he smiled, the way he'd helped that girl without embarrassment, the way every girl in the mess hall had reacted to him. I wasn't special in noticing him. Everyone noticed him. That was the point, wasn't it? He was universally admired, completely unattainable, and therefore perfectly safe to think about.

I could spend the summer watching him from a distance. He'd never know, so he could never reject me. He'd never talk to me long enough to discover I was boring, awkward, the kind of girl people forgot about immediately after meeting. I could build a whole fantasy in my head, and it would hurt no one, cost nothing, risk nothing.

The thought was both comforting and a little bit lonely, but lonely was familiar. Lonely was safe.

Behind me, I heard voices and laughter as other campers explored the waterfront area. Someone called about getting ready for dinner. The camp bell rang in the distance, clear and bright.

But I sat for another moment, watching the water, holding my book, and feeling the strange mix of dread and something that might have been hope.

Maybe I could survive eight weeks after all. Maybe having Michael Grant to look at, to think about, would make it bearable.

I stood, brushed off my shorts, and picked up Jane Eyre. Time to head back before someone came looking for me. Time to start learning the routines and rhythms of this place that would be my world for the rest of summer.

As I walked back up the dock toward the path, I glanced toward the mess hall area where counselors were gathering for their own dinner. Michael was there, laughing at something Mr. Davidson had said, looking easy and comfortable and completely unaware that a shy sixteen-year-old girl had just decided he was perfect.

Perfect and impossible.

Exactly what I needed.
