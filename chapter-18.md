# Chapter 18: The Reality Sets In

One week before the talent show, rehearsals intensified to every afternoon and some evenings. The mess hall became our second home, stage lights constantly on, cue sheets growing longer and more complicated with each practice session.

I'd become comfortable at my lighting station—knew which switches controlled which lights, had memorized most of the timing sequences, could anticipate transitions before acts even finished. The technical work satisfied something in me, a puzzle to solve with concrete right answers. Flip this switch here, dim that light there, and you created the perfect atmosphere for whatever happened on stage.

I spent hours running through cues with performers, getting the timing exactly right. The younger girls singing camp songs needed a soft, warm wash. Sparky's magic act—still disaster-prone but improving—required dramatic spotlights that could follow his movements. Betty's comedy sketch worked best with bright, flat lighting that let the audience see everyone's expressions.

Michael directed from the audience, his notebook full of blocking notes and suggestions. He was in his element—patient, encouraging, genuinely invested in making every performance shine. I watched him work and understood why I'd built a fantasy around him. He was kind. Competent. The type of person who made you feel safe and supported.

But that's all he'd ever been to me. A safe place to pour my emotions without risk, because the fantasy couldn't reject me.

Dorothy worked on the final touches of her backdrop—a beautiful sunset over water that would serve as the main set piece for the show. One afternoon when Michael took a water break, I watched her paint, adding shadows and highlights that made the whole thing come alive.

"It's beautiful," I said, approaching her workspace. "You're really talented."

"Thanks!" Dorothy smiled, genuine and warm. "It's been fun working on this. Michael has such great vision for what he wants, and translating that into visuals is satisfying." She added a touch of orange to the clouds. "How's the lighting coming?"

"Good. I think I have all the cues down. Just need to practice the transitions more."

"You're doing an amazing job. Michael said you've been indispensable—that everything runs so much smoother because you're on top of the technical stuff." She set down her brush. "I hope you're having fun with it and not feeling too stressed."

The kindness in her voice was real, with no condescension or awareness that I'd spent weeks harboring a crush on her boyfriend. She just saw me as a helpful younger camper, someone contributing to a shared project.

"I am having fun," I said, and meant it. "Thanks for recommending me."

"Of course. Michael needed someone reliable, and you seemed perfect."

I watched her return to her painting, adding details with careful precision. She and Michael made sense together—both creative, both dedicated to making camp better for others, both genuinely kind without ulterior motives.

When Michael returned and set his hand on Dorothy's shoulder, leaning down to see her progress, I felt nothing but a distant appreciation for how well-matched they were. The pang I'd expected didn't come. Just acknowledgment: *This is what it looks like when two people actually fit together.*

~~~

After rehearsal that evening, I stayed late to practice some complicated lighting transitions. The mess hall was empty except for me and the echo of my footsteps. I ran through the sequence three times, making notes about timing adjustments.

"You're still here?"

I looked up to find Jamie standing in the doorway, two bottles of Coca-Cola in his hands. He walked toward my station, offering me one.

"Final rehearsals are in two days," I said, accepting the bottle. "I want to make sure I don't mess up anyone's performance."

"You won't. You're too competent for that." He sat on the edge of my table, watching me make notes on my cue sheet. "How's it been? Working with Michael and Dorothy, I mean."

"Enlightening." I took a sip of the Coca-Cola, the fizz sharp and sweet. "You were right about all of it. Watching them together made it impossible to keep pretending there was something between me and Michael. There never was."

"That must have been rough to accept."

"It was weirdly not? Like, the fantasy hurt to let go of, but the reality was almost a relief. Does that make sense?"

Jamie nodded. "Perfect sense. Fantasies are work—constant maintenance, deliberate ignorance of contradicting facts. Reality just is. Even when it's disappointing, at least it's honest."

We sat in comfortable silence for a moment, drinking our Coca-Colas. The mess hall felt different empty—larger, echo-y, intimate in a way it never was during bustling rehearsals.

"Can I ask you something personal?" Jamie's voice was careful, like he was testing the waters.

"Sure."

"Do you regret it? The Michael thing, I mean. Do you wish you'd spent the summer differently?"

I thought about it honestly. "Parts of it, yeah. I wasted a lot of time and energy on something that was never real. But..." I paused, working out the thought. "If I hadn't been so focused on Michael, I might not have noticed you at first. Might have just stayed invisible and alone the whole summer."

"Pretty sure I would have noticed you regardless. You're not as good at invisible as you think."

"Why did you notice me?" The question came out before I could stop it. "That first week, when I was trying so hard to disappear—what made you keep showing up where I was?"

Jamie was quiet for a long moment, turning his Coca-Cola bottle in his hands. "Honestly? You reminded me of myself. Different method, same goal—protecting yourself by controlling how people saw you. You disappeared, I made chaos, but we were both performing. And when I saw you sitting on that dock with your book, looking like you wanted the whole world to leave you alone... I don't know. Something in me couldn't leave it alone."

"Even when I was mean to you about it?"

"Especially then. The more defensive you got, the more certain I was that you were hiding something real underneath." He smiled slightly. "I'm an annoying person, Palmer. I poke at things until they react."

"You are annoying," I agreed. "But you're also right about most things, which is even more annoying."

"One of my many talents."

The air between us felt charged somehow, full of things unsaid. I thought about his book of stories and art, about how every page had been about connection and being seen. About how he'd poured weeks of work into creating something beautiful and terrifying in its honesty.

"Have you decided?" I asked. "About the performance?"

"Yeah." He took a breath. "I'm doing it. Signed up today—solo performance, reading one of the stories and showing some of the art. Dorothy's going to help me set up an easel for the sketches."

"Jamie, that's great! What changed your mind?"

"You did." He said it simply, like it was obvious. "You looked at it and saw what it really was—not just me being weird or trying too hard, but something genuine. And I figured if I could share it with you and have you understand, maybe I could share it with everyone else."

My chest felt tight. "I'm proud of you. For being brave enough to do this."

"Ask me if I'm proud after I actually get through it without throwing up from nerves."

"You're going to be amazing." I believed it completely. "Everyone's expecting Jamie Sullivan chaos, and instead they're getting something real and beautiful. It'll catch them off guard in the best way."

"From your mouth to the universe's ears." He finished his Coca-Cola and set the bottle down. "What about you? Are you going to actually watch the show or be too busy with lights?"

"I can do both. My station gives me a good view of the stage."

"Good." Something in his expression shifted, became more vulnerable. "I'll need to see a friendly face in the audience when I'm up there panicking."

"I'll be right there. Promise."

We fell back into silence, but it was comfortable—the kind of quiet that came from knowing someone well enough that words weren't always necessary. Jamie stayed while I finished my practice runs, offering occasional suggestions or just providing company. When I finally packed up my cue sheets and turned off the stage lights, he walked back to the cabins with me.

The camp was settling down for the evening—counselors calling lights-out reminders, the sounds of girls preparing for bed drifting from cabin windows. Jamie and I walked slowly, prolonging the path back.

"Can I tell you something?" he asked as we neared the fork where our paths split.

"Always."

"This summer surprised me. I came here expecting the usual—cause some trouble, serve some punishment, count days until I could leave. But then you showed up and refused to be impressed by any of my acts, and somehow that made me want to actually be impressive instead of just performing impressive."

"You were always impressive. You just weren't letting anyone see it."

"Same goes for you." He stopped walking, turning to face me in the moonlit path. "You spent weeks trying to be invisible, but I saw you anyway. And I kept seeing you—getting braver, taking risks, letting yourself be present. You're different now than you were that first day."

"So are you."

"Yeah." He smiled, small and genuine. "We kind of fixed each other a little bit, didn't we?"

"Or at least helped each other stop hiding so much."

We stood there in the comfortable silence that had become our language. The summer was almost over—two more weeks after the talent show and we'd all be heading home to our real lives. The thought created an ache in my chest I didn't want to examine.

"See you tomorrow, Palmer."

"See you tomorrow, Sullivan."

I watched him walk toward the boys' cabins before heading to my own. Betty was already in bed but still awake, reading by flashlight.

"Late practice?" she asked, looking up from her book.

"Yeah. Wanted to get the transitions perfect."

"And?"

"And I spent some time with Jamie after. Talking."

Betty set her book aside, giving me her full attention. "How was that?"

"Good. Really good." I climbed into my bunk, settling in. "He decided to do his performance—the stories and art he's been working on. He's terrified but doing it anyway."

"That's brave."

"He is brave. He's been brave this whole summer—kept showing up, kept being honest, kept seeing me even when I tried to hide." I pulled my blanket up. "Betty, I think I'm falling for him. Actually falling, not just a safe crush. And it's terrifying."

"Because he could actually hurt you?"

"Because I could actually hurt him more. I already did once, with that fight. What if I do it again? What if I'm not good at this—at being vulnerable with someone who's being vulnerable back?"

Betty was quiet for a moment. "You know what I think? I think you're already doing it. You've been doing it for weeks. The friendship you have with Jamie—that's real vulnerability, real risk. Adding romantic feelings doesn't change that. It just makes you more aware of what you stand to lose."

She was right. The vulnerability was already there, had been since that night on the dock when we'd both shared our truths. The shift from friendship to something more just made it more obvious, more urgent.

More worth protecting.

I lay awake for a long time that night, thinking about Jamie's nervousness about his performance. About him creating something beautiful and scary in its honesty. About how he'd said I'd made him want to be impressive instead of just performing impressive.

About how maybe that's what real connection did—made you want to be your actual best self instead of the safe performance version.

Two days until the talent show. Then two weeks until summer ended.

Not enough time to figure everything out, but maybe enough time to be brave about what I wanted and whether I was willing to risk asking for it.

In the darkness, I could hear the lake through the window, waves lapping at the shore in their eternal rhythm. Steady. Persistent. Real.

I fell asleep thinking about real things and real feelings and the courage it took to share both.
