# Chapter 7: The Reading Spot Invasion

I found my real refuge on the sixth day.

The dock was too public, too much a part of the main camp activities. My bunk was surrounded by five other girls who meant well but didn't understand that sometimes silence was a necessity, not a preference. Even the library—a small room in the administration building with donated books and mismatched chairs—had too many people passing through.

But during free period on Saturday afternoon, while most campers were at organized activities or the canoe dock, I'd followed the shoreline past the main swimming area. The path curved away from camp, and through the trees, I glimpsed rocks—large, flat ones that looked like they'd been placed there specifically for hiding.

I pushed through the tall grass and found it: a cluster of boulders near the water's edge, hidden from the main camp by the bend in the shoreline and screened by vegetation. One flat rock was perfect for sitting, angled to provide a view of the lake while keeping your back to something solid. It was quiet here—truly quiet, with only the lap of water and rustle of grass in the breeze.

I settled onto the rock with The Secret Garden, the book I'd moved to after finishing Jane Eyre. Mary Lennox had just discovered the hidden garden, and I felt a kinship with her—finding secret places, preferring plants and solitude to people and noise.

The afternoon sun filtered through the leaves overhead, dappling the pages. The rock was warm beneath me. For the first time in nearly a week, I felt my shoulders truly relax, the constant tension of being around people finally easing.

I read for an hour, maybe more, lost in Mary's transformation and the garden's awakening. This was what I needed. This was—

"Huh. I thought I was the only one who knew about this spot."

I jumped so hard I nearly dropped my book. My head snapped up to find Jamie Sullivan standing at the edge of my hidden sanctuary, a sketchbook tucked under his arm and an expression of genuine surprise on his face.

"How did you find this?" The words came out accusatory, which I suppose they were. This was my spot. Mine. He couldn't keep showing up everywhere I tried to exist.

"I followed you." He said it so matter-of-factly that it took a second to process. When my expression shifted to alarm, he added quickly, "Not in a creepy way. I saw you sneak away from arts and crafts, and I was curious where you kept disappearing to. Figured you'd found somewhere good."

"So you decided to ruin it?"

"I decided to see if maybe we could share it." He gestured to the other end of the largest rock, a good six feet from where I sat. "I've been looking for a quiet place too. Camp's exhausting when you're always performing."

"You could go anywhere else. Literally anywhere. This is—" I stopped, not wanting to reveal how much I needed this space, how the thought of it being compromised made my chest tight.

"This is what? Your secret spot?" Jamie sat down anyway, at the far end like he'd promised, far enough that leaving would seem like an overreaction. "Sorry, Palmer. The rocks don't have your name on them. Public property."

I wanted to argue, to tell him to leave, to protect this one place from his intrusion. But the truth was, he'd already sat down, already claimed the other end of the rock, and short of physically pushing him into the lake, there wasn't much I could do.

"Fine," I said tightly. "But I was here first."

"Noted."

He opened his sketchbook and pulled a pencil from behind his ear—I hadn't even noticed it there. I tried to return to my book, but his presence made it impossible to sink back into the story. I was too aware of him, of the scratch of pencil on paper, of the way he sat with one knee pulled up and the sketchbook propped against it.

Minutes passed in uncomfortable silence. I read the same paragraph four times without retaining a word. Jamie kept sketching, occasionally pausing to look out at the lake before returning to his work.

The silence stretched. Five minutes. Ten. My shoulders started to relax incrementally despite my irritation. He wasn't talking, wasn't teasing, wasn't doing anything except existing in the same space. The scratch of his pencil became background noise, almost soothing in its rhythm.

I snuck a glance at him. He was focused entirely on whatever he was drawing, his expression serious in a way I'd never seen. The troublemaker facade had dropped completely, leaving someone who looked younger and somehow more real.

Curiosity won over resentment.

"What are you drawing?" I asked, my voice quiet so I wouldn't shatter the fragile peace.

Jamie looked up, surprised—I'd been silent for so long he'd probably forgotten I was there. He hesitated, then turned the sketchbook so I could see.

It was the view in front of us—the lake, the trees on the far shore, the way water reflected sky. But it wasn't just accurate; it was beautiful. He'd captured the quality of light on water, the texture of the trees, the sense of distance and space. The detail was incredible, showing patience and skill I wouldn't have attributed to someone who seemed to approach life with deliberate chaos.

"That's..." I searched for the right word. "That's really good."

"Thanks." He pulled the sketchbook back, studying his work with a critical eye. "Drawing keeps me from thinking too much."

The admission surprised me. "What do you need to not think about?"

He was quiet for a moment, pencil hovering over the page. "Same things you're reading to avoid, probably."

The answer created something unexpected between us—a recognition that we were doing the same thing with different tools. I hid in stories. He hid in art. Both of us trying to escape thoughts we didn't want to have.

"I'm not avoiding anything," I said, but it sounded like a lie even to me.

"Sure." He went back to his drawing, adding shading to the water. "You just happened to find the most hidden spot at camp and came here with a book about a secret garden. No symbolism there at all."

I should have been annoyed, but somehow I wasn't. "You're here too."

"I know. Which means either we're both trying to escape something, or we both just really like rocks." He glanced at me, something almost like a smile on his face. "I'm betting on the escaping thing."

We fell back into silence, but this time it felt different. Not uncomfortable or hostile—just quiet. Shared space without the pressure to fill it with words. He drew. I read. The afternoon sun moved across the sky, changing the quality of light on the page and on the water.

The bell for dinner rang in the distance, faint but clear. We both looked up at the same time.

"Camp's version of a church bell," Jamie said, closing his sketchbook. "Though instead of calling you to worship, it's calling you to mystery meat."

"It wasn't that bad yesterday."

"You have low standards, Palmer."

We stood, brushing grass and dirt from our clothes. The rock had left an imprint on the back of my legs, and I knew I'd have pink marks from sitting too long in one position. Jamie stretched, his t-shirt riding up slightly, and I looked away quickly.

"So," he said as we started back toward the main camp, following the path we'd both somehow found separately. "This spot stays secret, right? Don't need the entire camp discovering it."

"Agreed." I hugged The Secret Garden to my chest, still processing the last hour. We'd sat in the same space without fighting, without him teasing me, without the constant tension that usually defined our interactions. It had been... nice. Disturbingly nice.

"Same time tomorrow?" he asked, and I couldn't tell if he was serious or joking.

"This is my spot."

"Our spot now, apparently." He grinned, but it wasn't his usual cocky grin. It was smaller, almost genuine. "Come on, Palmer. We'll establish a schedule. You get it morning and evening, I get it afternoons. Shared custody."

"That's not how this works."

"How does it work then?"

I didn't have an answer. We'd reached the point where the path rejoined the main camp routes, and other campers were visible ahead, walking toward the mess hall. The noise of camp life grew louder—voices, laughter, the general chaos I'd been escaping.

"I'll think about it," I said finally.

"That's almost a yes. I'm counting it as a yes." Jamie started toward the mess hall, then turned back. "Hey, Palmer? What are you reading? The Secret Garden, right?"

"Yes."

"Any good?"

The question surprised me. Most people asked about books because they felt like they should, not because they cared about the answer. But Jamie's expression suggested genuine curiosity.

"It's about a girl who finds a hidden garden that's been locked up and forgotten," I said. "She brings it back to life, and it brings her back to life too."

"Metaphor heavy."

"It's a children's book from 1911. Metaphor was all they had." But I smiled saying it, which surprised me more than anything else that had happened today.

Jamie nodded, like I'd told him something important. "See you around, Palmer."

"See you around."

I watched him walk away, joining Sparky and some other boys heading into the mess hall. Then I stood there for a moment longer, trying to understand what had just happened.

I'd spent an hour in the same space as Jamie Sullivan without wanting to throttle him. We'd talked—actually talked, about real things—without his usual teasing edge. He'd shown me his art, something that clearly mattered to him, and I'd admitted that The Secret Garden was about more than just a garden.

It felt like something had shifted, like we'd stumbled into a truce without discussing terms.

Betty found me standing alone on the path. "There you are! I looked for you during free period. Where were you?"

"Just... around." I fell into step beside her, heading toward the mess hall. "Reading."

"You're always reading." She said it fondly, not as criticism. "One of these days, you're going to have to join the living, Lily Palmer."

Jamie's voice echoed in my head: "You're wasting it. Make a choice instead of just existing."

Maybe I was. Maybe I'd been so focused on hiding that I'd forgotten that hiding was a choice too—one that kept me safe but also kept me alone.

That evening at dinner, I found myself looking for Jamie across the mess hall. He was at his usual table, laughing about something with Sparky. But when he glanced up and our eyes met, he didn't smirk or grin. He just nodded slightly—acknowledgment of the afternoon, of the spot we now apparently shared, of something unspoken but understood.

I looked away first, focusing on the meatloaf on my plate that Betty was right to complain about. But I was thinking about the way Jamie's pencil had moved across the page, the serious expression on his face when he drew, the way he'd said drawing kept him from thinking too much.

We were more alike than I wanted to admit. Both hiding in our own ways. Both trying to escape thoughts that wouldn't stay quiet.

The realization should have been unsettling. Instead, it felt almost like relief.

At least I wasn't the only one.
