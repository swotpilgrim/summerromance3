# Chapter 17: Warnings and Wishes

Rehearsals began with the organized chaos only a talent show could generate.

The mess hall transformed each afternoon into a makeshift theater. Younger campers practiced songs off-key. Sparky's magic act involved a lot of fumbling with cards and scarves that somehow always ended up in the wrong place. Betty and the Cabin 7 girls worked on their comedy sketch, which consisted mainly of them cracking each other up before they could finish a scene.

I sat at my lighting station—a folding table to the side of the stage where the simple but effective lighting board was set up. Michael had walked me through the system: spotlights on stands that could be aimed and focused, basic stage washes controlled by switches and dimmers. Not complicated, but it required timing and attention.

I loved it.

For the first time all summer, I had a role that was useful without being visible. I could sit in the shadows, managing lights, watching the performances come together, being competent without being scrutinized. It was exactly what I'd wanted when I first arrived at camp—a place to contribute without being seen.

Except now the invisibility felt different. Less like safety, more like loneliness.

Michael directed from the audience section, clipboard in hand, offering encouragement and suggestions. "Great energy, but watch your timing on that punchline!" "Beautiful voice—maybe start a little softer and build?" "Sparky, buddy, you might want to practice that more before the actual show."

He was good at this—patient, constructive, genuinely invested in making every act work. I could see why campers loved him. Why I'd built a fantasy around him.

And I could see, with increasing clarity, that it had only ever been a fantasy.

Dorothy worked on sets in the corner, painting a backdrop of a sunset over water. When she and Michael took a break, I watched them share coffee from a thermos she'd brought. They stood close, talking in low voices, shoulders touching. At one point, he said something that made her laugh and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear—a gesture so intimate and unconscious that I had to look away.

It didn't hurt the way I'd expected. It just felt true. This was what caring about someone looked like when it was real and returned. And it had never been how Michael looked at me.

"How's it going up there?"

I jumped, nearly knocking over my cue sheet. Jamie stood at the edge of my station, hands in his pockets, watching me with that perceptive expression that suggested he'd seen exactly where my attention had been.

"Fine. Good. Just reviewing the lighting sequence for Betty's sketch."

"Liar. You were watching them." He gestured subtly toward Michael and Dorothy. "How's that sitting with you?"

"Better than I expected." I straightened my papers unnecessarily. "It's obvious they're together. I don't know how I didn't see it before."

"You saw what you wanted to see. We all do that." He leaned against my table. "So you're really okay?"

"I think so. It's weird—like mourning something that never existed. But yeah, I'm okay."

Jamie nodded, something like relief crossing his face. "Good. That's good." He paused, then asked carefully, "Do you think you'd have felt differently if he'd actually been interested? Or was it the safety of him not being available that made it work as a crush?"

The question was too perceptive, and I wanted to be annoyed, but I'd asked him to stop hiding from me. That meant I couldn't hide from him either.

"Honestly? I think the safety was part of it. If he'd been available, it would have been scary. Real stakes, real risk of rejection. This way I could have all the feelings without any of the vulnerability."

"That's very self-aware of you, Palmer."

"I'm learning from someone who's annoyingly good at calling me on my deflections."

He grinned. "It's one of my many talents." His expression shifted to something more serious. "Can I ask you something?"

"Sure."

"Are you signing up for the talent show because you genuinely want to help backstage, or because it gives you an excuse to keep watching Michael?"

I opened my mouth to protest, then stopped. Really thought about it. "Both? Or maybe it started as the second thing and it's becoming the first. I actually like this—" I gestured to the lighting board. "Figuring out the technical stuff, making the acts look good. It feels useful in a way that's separate from him."

"Okay." Jamie pushed off from the table. "Just checking. I don't want you to get hurt, and I know the show's in less than two weeks. You'll be watching him with Dorothy a lot more before this is over."

"I'll be okay. Promise." I paused, then asked, "What about you? Are you really performing? Sparky says you've been working on something secret."

Something flickered across Jamie's face—nervousness, maybe, or uncertainty. "Yeah. Maybe. I'm still deciding."

"That's not like you. Usually you're first in line for attention."

"This is different." He ran his hand through his hair, that gesture I'd come to recognize as him working through something difficult. "The usual pranks and chaos—that's performance. Safe, controlled, exactly what people expect. This thing I'm working on... it's real. And putting real things out there is scary."

The honesty in his voice made something tighten in my chest. "Can you tell me what it is?"

"Not yet. Maybe after rehearsals today I'll show you—if you want to stick around."

"I want to."

He smiled, genuine and a little nervous. "Okay. After everyone leaves, meet me by the back entrance."

~~~

Rehearsals ran long. A group of girls couldn't agree on harmonies. Sparky's card trick failed five times in a row. Michael had to mediate a dispute about performance order. By the time everyone finally cleared out, my cue sheet was covered in notes and modifications, and the mess hall felt too quiet after the afternoon's chaos.

I waited by the back entrance as instructed, wondering what Jamie wanted to show me. He appeared a few minutes later, carrying something wrapped in cloth.

"Come on," he said, leading me toward the stage. "I want to run through this where I'd actually be performing. For context."

"You're making me nervous."

"Good. I'm nervous too." He set the wrapped object on the stage and turned to me. "Okay, so you know how I've been spending time at the arts and crafts building?"

"The whole camp knows. There's a betting pool about what you're making."

He laughed, short and nervous. "Of course there is. Well, I haven't been making something. I've been working on... this."

He pulled the cloth away to reveal a hand-bound book—leather cover, pages sewn together with careful stitches, clearly made by hand. The craftsmanship was beautiful, detailed in a way that showed hours of work.

"You made a book?"

"Not exactly." He picked it up, holding it like something precious. "Dorothy helped me with the binding and showed me how to do leather work. But the content is... well. Do you want to see?"

I nodded, not trusting my voice. Jamie handed me the book, and I opened it carefully.

The first page held a watercolor painting of the lake at sunset, the colors blending beautifully. The next page had a short piece of writing—a story, I realized, about a girl who lived inside books until someone taught her that real life could be just as good. Another page featured a sketch of the reading spot by the rocks. Then another story, this one about a boy who caused trouble because being notorious was better than being forgotten.

Page after page, stories and art alternated. Some pieces were about camp directly—a girl learning to swim despite her fear, a boy who discovered that making someone else feel valued was better than any prank. Others were more abstract, using different settings and characters but clearly about the same themes.

About being seen. About being known. About finding unexpected connections.

About us.

"Jamie," I whispered, my throat tight. "This is beautiful."

"It's my talent show act. Was supposed to be, anyway." He sat on the edge of the stage, nervous energy making him fidget. "I was going to read one of the stories, maybe show some of the art. But now I'm thinking it's too much. Too sincere, too revealing. Everyone's expecting me to do something funny or chaotic, and instead I'd be reading a story about—" He stopped abruptly.

"About what?"

"About you," he said quietly. "About us. About the summer. And that feels scary in a way pranks never do, because it's real and what if people think it's stupid or what if they don't get it or—"

"Jamie." I sat beside him on the stage, the book still open in my lap. "This is incredible. The writing, the art—it's all incredible. When did you have time to make all this?"

"Couldn't sleep most nights. Too much in my head. So I'd go to the craft building after hours and work on this. Dorothy found me one night and instead of turning me in, she helped. Showed me binding techniques, let me raid her supply closet." He looked at the book in my hands. "Every story is from this summer. Things I noticed, moments that mattered. That one—" he pointed to a page featuring a sketch of the scavenger hunt "—is about teamwork. And that one is about unexpected friendships."

I turned pages slowly, reading fragments, studying the artwork. Every piece showed skill and thought and time. This wasn't something Jamie had thrown together on a whim—this was weeks of careful work, vulnerable work, the kind of creation that revealed the person behind it completely.

"Are you going to perform this?" I asked.

"I don't know. Part of me wants to—wants to show people I'm more than the troublemaker act, that I can make something meaningful. But it's scary. What if I get up there and everyone just waits for the punchline that never comes?"

"What if they love it?" I countered. "What if they see what I'm seeing—that you're talented and creative and brave enough to share something real?"

He looked at me, something vulnerable in his expression. "You really think it's good?"

"I think it's beautiful. I think you should absolutely perform this." I closed the book carefully, handing it back to him. "But it has to be your choice. If you're not ready to share it, that's okay too."

Jamie held the book, turning it over in his hands. "When I started this, I thought maybe I'd give it to you. As a gift, you know? Something to remember the summer. But then the talent show was announced, and I thought... what if I could turn it into a performance? What if I could show everyone, including you, that I can create instead of just destroy?"

My chest felt tight, full of something I couldn't quite name. "This would be an amazing performance. But Jamie—you don't have to prove anything to anyone. This is enough. You're enough."

"Maybe I need to prove it to myself."

We sat there as the afternoon light shifted through the mess hall windows, the book between us like a promise or a confession. Finally, Jamie stood, rewrapping the book in its protective cloth.

"I'll think about it. Decide in the next few days." He offered me a hand to help me up from the stage. "Thanks for looking at it. For understanding what it is."

"Thank you for showing me." I wanted to say more—about how the stories had moved me, about recognizing us in the pages, about the way my heart had clenched seeing his vulnerability transformed into art. But the words felt too big, too revealing.

Instead, I just said, "Whatever you decide, I'll be in the audience supporting you. Or working your lights if you do perform. Either way."

His smile was small but genuine. "I know."

~~~

Walking back to the cabins, I couldn't stop thinking about the book. About the care Jamie had put into each page, the way he'd transformed moments from our summer into stories and art. About how he'd seen things I hadn't noticed I was showing—my fear, my gradual opening up, the shift from hiding to being present.

He'd been paying attention all summer. Really paying attention. Not in the general way Michael paid attention to all his campers, but in a specific, focused way that saw me clearly.

The realization sat heavy and warm in my chest.

Betty was waiting on the cabin porch, and from her expression, she had questions.

"You're smiling," she observed. "A real smile, not your polite social smile. What happened?"

"Jamie showed me what he's been working on for the talent show."

"And?"

"And it's beautiful. He made this book with stories and art, and it's all about the summer, about friendship and connection and being seen." I sat beside her on the porch steps. "Betty, he's really talented. Like, genuinely talented. And he's terrified to show anyone because it means being vulnerable in a way his troublemaker act never requires."

Betty watched me carefully. "You really care about him, don't you? Not just as a friend."

I wanted to deflect, to hide behind my usual defenses. But I was tired of hiding.

"Yeah," I admitted. "I think I do. I'm not sure when it happened—maybe slowly over weeks, maybe all at once when he kept showing up and seeing me. But yeah. I care about him. A lot."

"Does he know?"

"I don't know. Maybe? He knows I care as a friend. But this other thing..." I trailed off, uncertain.

"You should tell him."

"I don't know if I'm ready. The Michael thing was safe because it was fantasy. This with Jamie—it's real. He could actually hurt me. Or I could hurt him worse than I already have."

Betty put her arm around my shoulders. "That's how you know it matters, Lily. If it didn't have the power to hurt, it wouldn't be worth having."

I leaned against her, grateful for her friendship and her patience with my slow, stumbling journey toward being honest about my feelings.

Two weeks until the talent show. Two weeks of rehearsals and lighting cues and watching Jamie decide whether he was brave enough to share his real self with the camp.

Two weeks to figure out what I wanted and whether I was brave enough to risk asking for it.

For the first time, the idea felt less terrifying than it should. Because Jamie had shown me his vulnerabilities in leather-bound pages and watercolor, and he'd trusted me with the real him.

Maybe it was time I returned the favor.
