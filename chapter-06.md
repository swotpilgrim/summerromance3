# Chapter 6: Truth at the Campfire

I'd avoided Jamie Sullivan for two days. It wasn't hard—Camp Silver Lake was big enough that you could navigate around one person if you paid attention. I skipped arts and crafts on Tuesday, claiming a headache to Betty and spending the time in the cabin with Wuthering Heights. I arrived exactly on time for swimming so there were no moments alone with Michael but also no chance of Jamie showing up early. At meals, I sat with my back to his usual table and focused very hard on Betty's cheerful chatter about everything and nothing.

By Friday evening, I'd almost convinced myself the fight on the path hadn't bothered me. I'd certainly convinced myself that Jamie's words didn't matter, that he was just a troublemaker saying mean things because that's what troublemakers did.

Then came the campfire.

It was a camp tradition, Betty had explained. Every Friday evening, the entire camp gathered around the stone fire pit near the lake. Counselors led songs, campers roasted marshmallows, and for a few hours, everyone pretended they were in some wholesome movie about summer camp innocence.

I'd tried to beg off, but Miss Patterson had been firm: Friday campfire was mandatory unless you were actively dying. "Camp community," she'd said with a smile that suggested this was non-negotiable.

So I found myself walking down to the fire circle with the other girls from Cabin 7 as the sun set and the air took on that perfect summer evening temperature—warm enough to be comfortable, cool enough to make a fire feel cozy rather than oppressive.

The fire pit was already blazing when we arrived, flames crackling and sending sparks up toward the darkening sky. Log benches circled the fire in concentric rings, and campers claimed spots with their friends and cabin-mates. The smell of wood smoke and pine mixed with the scent of the lake, and despite my reluctance to be here, I had to admit it was beautiful.

Betty led our group to a log in the middle section—close enough to see but not so close we'd roast. I sat between Betty and Sandra, hoping to disappear into the group, just another face in the firelight.

Michael stood near the fire with his guitar—an acoustic that looked well-loved, the wood worn smooth in places. He strummed a few chords, tuning, and the sound cut through the chatter. Girls quieted, attention shifting to him the way it always did.

"Evening, everyone!" His voice carried easily over the crackle of the fire. "Who's ready to sing?"

Enthusiastic cheers answered him. I stayed silent but felt something warm unfold in my chest just watching him. The firelight caught his features, made him look like something from a painting. He started playing "Kumbaya," and the whole camp joined in, voices blending in that way that only happened when everyone sang together.

I didn't sing—singing meant drawing attention to yourself—but I mouthed the words and let myself just watch. This was safe. This was perfect. Michael playing guitar, me anonymous in a crowd, able to observe without being observed.

Then someone sat down next to me.

The log shifted with the additional weight, and I didn't need to look to know who it was. I'd spent enough time aware of Jamie Sullivan's presence over the past week to recognize it now.

"Evening, Palmer." He spoke quietly enough that the people around us couldn't hear over the singing, but I heard him perfectly. "Nice night for a fire."

I didn't respond. Maybe if I ignored him, he'd go away.

"You've been avoiding me," he continued, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a marshmallow—where he'd gotten it, I had no idea. He stuck it on a wire hanger and held it toward the fire. "That takes effort at a camp this size. I'm almost impressed."

"Go away, Jamie."

"Can't. All the other spots are taken. Plus, I wanted to apologize."

That made me look at him. He was watching his marshmallow rotate slowly over the flames, his expression unreadable in the firelight.

"For what?" I asked, not bothering to hide my skepticism.

"For being a jerk the other day. I said some things that were..." He paused, searching for the word. "True, but mean. The delivery could have been better."

"You think?" I turned my attention back to Michael, who was transitioning into "Down by the Bay." "The delivery could have been nonexistent. That would have been better."

"Probably." He pulled his marshmallow back—perfectly golden—and took a bite. "But you were still planning to waste your whole summer staring at Michael Grant and hoping he'd notice you, so somebody needed to say something."

"I'm not—" I stopped, aware of Betty on my other side. I lowered my voice to a harsh whisper. "Can you please stop talking about this? Here? Where everyone can hear?"

"Everyone's singing. No one's paying attention to us." He was right—the song had reached the chorus, and the volume had increased accordingly. "I'm just saying, you volunteer for every activity he runs, you show up early to swimming, you watch him constantly. What's your endgame? What do you think is going to happen?"

The question hit at something I didn't want to examine. Because the truth was, I hadn't thought past the watching. The crush felt good—safe and exciting at the same time. It gave me something to focus on besides counting days until I could go home.

"I don't have an 'endgame,'" I said stiffly. "I just... I think he's nice. Is that a crime?"

"It's not a crime. It's just sad." Jamie's marshmallow was gone, and now he was just sitting there, looking at me with something that might have been concern if I believed he was capable of that. "You could actually try talking to him. Like, having a real conversation. Ask him about college, or swimming, or literally anything. Be a person instead of a ghost."

"I have talked to him."

"'Good morning' and 'thank you' don't count." He leaned back, the log creaking under the shift in weight. "You're so busy worshiping from a distance that you're not even trying for anything real. And yeah, maybe nothing would happen anyway because he's a counselor and you're a camper. But at least then you'd know. You'd have actually tried instead of just... existing in his orbit and hoping he'll magically fall for you."

The words stung because somewhere underneath the meanness, there was something uncomfortably close to truth. I had been hiding. Watching was safer than talking because talking meant risking rejection, meant Michael might look at me and see nothing special, might forget my name the second I walked away.

"Why do you care?" I asked, the same question I'd asked on the path two days ago. "Why does it matter to you what I do?"

Jamie was quiet for a long moment. The fire crackled, the singing continued—someone had started "Michael Row the Boat Ashore," which felt cosmically unfair given our conversation. Finally, he said, "I don't know. You're just... you're wasting it. The summer, I mean. You came here all locked up and defensive, hiding behind books, and now you're hiding behind a crush on someone safe because he can't hurt you if he never really sees you. It's like watching someone drowning and refusing to swim."

"That's very poetic for someone who puts frogs in desks."

"The frog was metaphorical." I could hear the grin in his voice even without looking at him. "I was making a statement about the absurdity of institutional authority."

"You were being annoying."

"That too." He stood, brushing ash from his shorts. "Just think about it, okay? Maybe actually talk to Michael. Or don't, and spend eight weeks mooning over someone who'll never see you as more than a helpful camper. But make a choice instead of just... existing."

He walked away, circling the fire to sit with Sparky and some other boys on the opposite side. I watched him go, angry and confused and hating that his words had lodged in my brain like splinters I couldn't quite remove.

Betty nudged me. "What was that about?"

"Nothing. Jamie being Jamie."

"He was sitting really close." She had that speculative look girls get when they sense romantic drama. "Are you sure there's nothing—"

"I'm sure. He's just annoying."

She didn't look convinced but let it drop. The singing continued, Michael leading song after song with easy competence. I tried to focus on him, on the way his fingers moved on the guitar strings, on his smile when someone shouted out a request. This was what I wanted—to watch him, to feel that flutter in my chest, to have something pleasant to think about.

But Jamie's voice kept intruding: "You're wasting it. You're hiding. Make a choice instead of just existing."

After the singing ended, counselors distributed marshmallows and wire hangers for roasting. Girls clustered in groups, laughing and gossiping and making friendship bracelets while their marshmallows caught fire or dripped into the flames. I roasted one carefully, methodically, the way I did everything—controlled and precise and safe.

Michael moved through the groups, making sure everyone had supplies, joking with the younger kids, stopping to help a girl whose marshmallow had burst into flames. When he reached our group, he smiled that universal friendly smile.

"Everyone having a good time?"

Chorus of yeses from Betty and the others. I nodded silently.

"Great." He moved on to the next group without really seeing any of us.

I watched him go and thought about Jamie's words. "He'll never see you as more than a helpful camper." Was that true? Was I really that invisible? Or was Jamie just being cruel, trying to make me feel bad about something that made me feel good?

The fire burned lower as the evening progressed. Sparks drifted up toward stars that were becoming visible in the deepening sky. The air cooled enough that the fire's warmth felt necessary rather than pleasant. Around me, girls talked and laughed, existing in their friendships and summer experiences without the constant second-guessing that plagued every moment of my life.

I caught Jamie's eye across the fire. He was listening to something Sparky was saying, but his gaze had drifted to me. When our eyes met, he didn't grin or smirk. He just looked at me, something serious in his expression, before turning back to his friends.

I looked away first, staring into the flames until they blurred.

The walk back to the cabins happened in groups, flashlights cutting through darkness on the paths. Betty walked beside me, still chattering about the campfire, about how nice Michael looked playing guitar, about how someone said there might be a joint dance with the boys' camp later in the summer.

"That would be so dreamy," she sighed. "Dancing under the stars with a cute boy..."

I made agreeing sounds while my mind replayed the evening. Jamie sitting too close, his quiet words about wasting my summer, the way Michael had passed our group without really seeing me.

In my bunk that night, I lay awake long after lights-out, staring at the ceiling and listening to the other girls' breathing settle into sleep. My fingers found the spine of Pride and Prejudice on the shelf beside me, seeking comfort in the familiar.

But for once, even the promise of Elizabeth Bennet's world couldn't quiet my thoughts.

Jamie was wrong. He had to be wrong. The crush on Michael was safe and pleasant and gave structure to days that would otherwise be just endurance. It wasn't wasting—it was surviving. It was getting through eight weeks without getting hurt.

Except a small, treacherous voice in my head whispered that maybe Jamie was right. Maybe I was hiding. Maybe watching from a distance wasn't really living, just a different kind of disappearing.

Maybe I'd come to Camp Silver Lake already planning to be invisible, and the crush on Michael was just another way to ensure I never had to risk being seen.

The thought kept me awake long after I wanted to sleep, uncomfortable and persistent.

Outside, the lake lapped at the shore, indifferent to the turmoil of one sixteen-year-old girl who was starting to wonder if the boy who annoyed her most might understand her better than anyone else here.

I hated that thought almost as much as I hated Jamie Sullivan himself.

Almost.
