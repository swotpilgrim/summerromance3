# Chapter 13: The Fight

I avoided Jamie for three days.

In a camp as small as Silver Lake, this required strategic planning and constant vigilance. I learned his schedule, figured out which paths he took between activities, timed my meals to arrive after he'd already claimed his table. When I saw his dark hair or heard his laugh, I went the other direction.

It should have been satisfying—shutting him out the way he'd gutted me with his harsh truths. Instead, it just felt empty. But I wasn't ready to examine why, so I threw myself into proving him wrong about Michael.

If Jamie thought Michael didn't notice me, I'd make him notice. I'd be so helpful, so present, so perfect that Michael would have to see me as more than just a reliable volunteer.

Monday morning swimming, I pushed myself harder than I ever had. My arms burned, my lungs screamed, but I perfected my freestyle stroke through sheer determination. When Michael called us in to demonstrate proper flip turns, I was first in line, first to volunteer, eager to show him my improvement.

"Great job, Lily!" he called as I surfaced from a decent—if not perfect—flip turn. "You've really improved since the first week. Keep practicing that motion, and you'll have it down solid."

See? I wanted to shout at Jamie wherever he was. Michael notices me. He said my name. He complimented my improvement.

Except Jamie wasn't there to hear it. He'd been confined to the dock for his latest prank—something involving the camp flag and what I'd overheard was Mrs. Morrison's laundry line. He sat on the wooden planks in a time-out like a child, sketching in his notebook, occasionally glancing up at our swimming class.

I tried not to look at him. Tried not to notice when his eyes found me in the water. Tried not to care what expression he wore while watching me demonstrate my hard-earned flip turn for Michael's approval.

After swimming, Michael stopped me on the dock. "You're really coming along, Lily. Have you thought about trying out for your school's swim team? With some practice, you could be competitive."

"Really?" My heart soared. This was it—personal attention, genuine interest, the kind of moment that proved Jamie wrong.

"Absolutely. You've got natural athleticism once you got over the initial fear. That's half the battle." He checked his watch. "I need to get to the counselor meeting, but keep up the good work!"

He jogged off toward the main building, already thinking about whatever came next. I stood there on the dock, dripping lake water, trying to hold onto the glow of his praise.

"Congrats on the flip turn."

I spun to find Jamie still sitting at the dock's edge, his sketchbook closed now. His voice was neutral, but something in his expression made my anger flare back to life.

"I don't want to talk to you."

"Got it." But he didn't move. "Michael's right, though. You have improved a lot."

"Don't."

"Don't what?"

"Don't pretend you care or that you're being supportive." I grabbed my towel, wrapping it around myself like armor. "You made it very clear what you think of me and my'sad crush on someone who'll never want me.'"

Jamie flinched at my mocking tone. "That's not what I said."

"It's exactly what you said. You called me cowardly."

"I said hiding behind a safe fantasy was cowardly. There's a difference."

"No, there isn't." I started walking away, but his voice followed me.

"Lily, wait—"

"Leave me alone, Jamie. You said what you needed to say. Now let me deal with it however I want."

I kept walking, but I could feel his eyes on me all the way back to the cabin.

~~~

By afternoon, I'd convinced myself the swimming praise meant something. Michael had noticed my improvement. He'd suggested I try out for my school team. That was personal, right? That was him caring about my future, seeing potential in me.

Arts and crafts was scheduled for the afternoon, and I fully intended to go to archery instead—my actual assigned activity. But as I passed the craft building on the way to the archery range, I saw Dorothy setting up for a session on friendship bracelets.

And I saw Michael on the porch, visible through the open doorway.

My feet carried me inside before my brain caught up.

"Lily!" Dorothy greeted me warmly. "Here for bracelet-making? Great! Grab a seat and I'll get you set up with string."

I chose a table near the porch where Michael sat reading something official-looking, probably camp paperwork. Close enough to be in his orbit, not so close it looked desperate.

I'd been working on my bracelet—a blue and green pattern that was more complicated than I'd expected—for maybe ten minutes when someone slid onto the bench across from me.

Jamie.

"What are you doing here?" I kept my voice low, hyperaware of Dorothy nearby and Michael on the porch. "This is arts and crafts. You're supposed to be at archery."

"Archery got boring." He grabbed a pile of bracelet string from the supply basket, selecting red and black. "Plus I saw you come in here, and we need to talk."

"No, we don't."

"Yeah, we do." He started his bracelet with practiced ease, his fingers nimble with the string. "You've been avoiding me for three days."

"I've been busy."

"You've been proving a point. How's that working out?"

I focused very hard on my bracelet, pulling the strings tighter than necessary. "I don't know what you're talking about."

"You're killing yourself in swimming to get Michael to notice you. Volunteering for everything, showing up everywhere he is, trying to be indispensable." Jamie's voice was quiet but relentless. "And he complimented your flip turn and suggested you try out for a team. Very encouraging. Very counselor-ly. Very much not romantic interest."

"You don't know that."

"I do, actually. I've been watching—"

"Stop watching me!" The words came out louder than intended. A few girls at other tables glanced over. I lowered my voice to a harsh whisper. "Why can't you just leave me alone? I'm fine. Michael and I are fine. Everything is fine."

"You're not fine. And you're setting yourself up to get hurt worse by dragging this out."

"How long are you planning to ignore him?" Dorothy's voice made us both jump. She stood beside our table, looking concerned. "Jamie, you're being disruptive. Lily looks upset. Maybe you two should take this conversation outside?"

She said it kindly, but it wasn't a request.

Jamie stood immediately, gathering his partially completed bracelet. I had no choice but to follow, my own bracelet abandoned on the table. We walked out of the craft building and down the path toward the woods, away from curious ears.

The moment we were out of sight from the main camp, everything that had been building for three days exploded.

"You just can't help yourself, can you?" I said, my voice shaking with anger. "You have to show up and ruin things and make sure I know how pathetic you think I am."

"I don't think you're pathetic! I think you're wasting your summer on someone who's never going to—"

"So you've said. Multiple times. I got the message, Jamie. You think I'm a coward hiding behind a fantasy. You think I'm too scared to risk anything real. You think you're so much braver than me because you act out and get in trouble and make sure everyone sees you."

"That's not what I—"

"At least I'm not desperate for attention like you are!" The words kept coming, three days of hurt and anger pouring out unchecked. "At least I'm not trying to force people to notice me through pranks and chaos. At least I'm not—"

"At least you're not what, Lily? At least you're not honest about what you want? At least you're not risking rejection?" His voice rose to match mine. "You're so scared of being hurt that you won't even try for something real. You'd rather pine for someone safe who'll never want you back than take a chance on someone who actually sees you!"

"And who's that supposed to be? You?" I laughed, mean and sharp. "You think you're better than Michael? You're a troublemaker who can't go three days without getting in trouble. You're so busy performing your whole bad boy act that you don't let anyone actually know you. You chase away everyone who tries to care—"

"Don't." His voice went cold, warning. "Don't go there."

But I was too angry to stop, too hurt to pull back. "That's why your parents don't want you around, isn't it? Because you're exhausting. Because it's easier to send you to camp for the summer than deal with your constant need for attention. You're a problem to be solved, and honestly? I get it."

The words hung in the air like smoke, poisonous and irreversible.

Jamie's face went completely blank—not the hurt I'd seen three days ago, but something worse. Empty. The defensive mask he wore when he'd given up on someone seeing past it.

"At least when my parents rejected me, I knew it was real," he said quietly. "They looked at the actual me and decided I wasn't worth the trouble. You won't even let Michael see the real you because you're so terrified he'll do the same thing. You hide behind books and silence and this sad little crush because being invisible is easier than being seen and found wanting."

Tears spilled down my face, hot and humiliating. "I hate you."

"Yeah, I got that the first time." His voice was flat, emotionless in a way that was somehow worse than anger. "Let me make this easy for you: I'll stop caring about what you do or who you chase or how you waste your summer. You can spend the next five weeks pining for Michael in peace. I won't bother you again."

"Good."

"Great." But something flickered in his eyes—hurt, maybe, or regret. It was gone too quickly to read. "For what it's worth, I wasn't trying to ruin your summer. I was trying to save you from wasting it. But you're right—it's not my business. Enjoy your fantasy, Palmer."

He turned and walked away, back toward the main camp. I stood alone on the path, crying harder than I had since I was a child, my whole body shaking with sobs I couldn't control.

I'd used his deepest wound as a weapon. I'd thrown his parents' rejection in his face, weaponized the vulnerability he'd shared with me that night on the dock when we'd both been honest and fragile and trusting.

I'd proven I wasn't safe. Wasn't worthy of the friendship he'd offered.

And the worst part—the absolute worst part—was that his final words had landed like punches: *You're so terrified he'll look at the real you and find you wanting.*

Because he was right.

I walked slowly back to Cabin 7, bypassing the mess hall and dinner entirely. Betty found me lying in my bunk an hour later, my face swollen from crying, The Catcher in the Rye unopened beside me.

"What happened?" She climbed up to sit at the foot of my bunk, her expression concerned. "I heard you and Jamie fought."

"We're not friends anymore."

"Lily—"

"I don't want to talk about it." My voice was rough, raw. "Please, Betty. I just want to be alone."

She looked like she wanted to argue but finally nodded. "Okay. But if you change your mind..."

After she left, I lay in the gathering darkness, listening to the sounds of camp through the screen windows. Girls laughing, counselors calling instructions for evening activities, the distant sounds of someone's radio playing a Beach Boys song.

Normal summer camp sounds. Everything continuing on like my world hadn't just cracked apart.

I pulled my blanket over my head and let myself cry again, quieter this time but no less painful. I cried for the friendship I'd destroyed, for the cruel things I'd said, for the way Jamie's face had gone blank when I'd mentioned his parents.

For the terrible truth in his words that I still wasn't ready to face.

Somewhere across camp, Jamie was probably telling Sparky he'd been right to warn him about getting close to people. Probably rebuilding his defensive walls, going back to the troublemaker performance that kept everyone at a safe distance.

And it was my fault.

I'd proven him right about what happened when he let people see the real him. They used it to hurt him.

The thought made me cry harder, but quietly, so the other girls wouldn't hear when they came back from evening activities.

I'd come to Camp Silver Lake wanting to be invisible, to hide, to wait out eight weeks before returning to my real life.

Now I'd managed to lose the one person who'd actually seen me. And I had no one to blame but myself.
