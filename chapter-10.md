# Chapter 10: The First Real Connection

I woke to Betty's voice announcing breakfast in thirty minutes, and my first thought was about last night. The dock. Jamie. Everything we'd told each other in the darkness.

My second thought was wondering if it would be weird now. If sharing that much truth had been a mistake, if in daylight he'd regret the vulnerability and go back to being the troublemaker who kept me off-balance.

My third thought, as I climbed down from my bunk and reached for my clothes, was that I was thinking about Jamie Sullivan before I'd even brushed my teeth.

That felt significant.

~~~

The mess hall buzzed with the usual breakfast chaos—girls comparing plans for the day, counselors reviewing activity schedules, the clatter of dishes and the smell of oatmeal and toast. I filled my tray and paused at the threshold of the dining area, scanning the room without meaning to.

Looking for him.

I found him at his usual table with Sparky and some other boys, leaning back in his seat while Sparky gestured wildly about something. Jamie was listening, nodding, but his attention wasn't fully there. His eyes were scanning the room too.

When our gazes met, everything else seemed to fall away for a second. He didn't grin or smirk. He just looked at me, and something passed between us—acknowledgment of last night, of what we'd shared, of the fact that we'd seen each other truly and neither of us had run away.

He nodded slightly. I nodded back. Betty was calling my name from our usual table, but I stood there for another moment, holding Jamie's gaze across the crowded mess hall.

Then I looked away first and carried my tray to where Betty waited, my heart doing something complicated in my chest.

"You okay?" Betty asked as I sat down. "You looked sort of dazed."

"Just tired. Didn't sleep well."

"Oh, that's too bad. Maybe you can nap during free period?" She launched into a story about something that had happened in her cabin last night, and I made appropriate listening sounds while my mind stayed on that moment with Jamie.

Everything felt different this morning. The air felt different. My skin felt different. Like I'd spent sixteen years walking around numb and someone had suddenly restored sensation to every nerve.

It was terrifying and exhilarating at the same time.

~~~

Swimming lesson came around with its usual inevitability. I'd stopped dreading it after the first week—my strokes had improved, I could hold my breath longer, and Michael's encouragement felt nice even if it wasn't the romantic attention I'd originally craved.

But today, standing on the dock with the rest of the beginner group, I wasn't thinking about Michael at all. I was aware of Jamie's absence—he'd been scarce at lessons lately, probably because Michael had threatened to kick him out for disrupting class.

Michael gathered us together for the day's focus: diving technique. He demonstrated a clean dive from the dock, his form perfect, barely making a splash. When he surfaced, he called for volunteers to try.

Several hands shot up. Mine didn't. The thought of diving in front of everyone, of being watched while I inevitably belly-flopped or went in at the wrong angle, made my stomach knot.

"Lily," Michael said, and my heart stopped. "You haven't volunteered yet. Want to give it a try?"

Every eye turned to me. Betty gave me an encouraging smile. The younger girls watched with the curiosity of people who wanted to see if the quiet girl would succeed or fail.

I opened my mouth to make an excuse, to say I wasn't ready, to deflect attention away from myself the way I always did. The panic was rising in my throat, familiar and suffocating.

"I'll do it!"

Jamie's voice cut through my spiraling thoughts. He appeared from the trees, jogging toward the dock like he'd been there all along and we just hadn't noticed.

"Jamie," Michael sighed. "You're not even in this class anymore."

"I know, but I've been working on my diving form, and I'd love your feedback." Jamie positioned himself at the edge of the dock, ignoring Michael's skeptical expression. "Watch this."

He ran, jumped, and executed the most spectacular belly-flop I'd ever seen. He hit the water flat, making a sound like a gunshot and sending spray everywhere. When he surfaced, he was gasping and red-faced, clutching his stomach.

"How was that?" he called to Michael, his voice strained. "Good form?"

The younger girls giggled. Even Michael cracked a smile despite his obvious frustration. "That was possibly the worst dive I've ever witnessed. Everyone, that's exactly what NOT to do. Jamie, get out of the swimming area before I report you to Mrs. Morrison."

"Right, sorry, on my way." Jamie hauled himself onto the dock, water streaming from his clothes. As he passed me, he muttered under his breath, just loud enough for me to hear: "You looked terrified. Figured you'd rather not be the center of attention."

Then he was gone, walking back toward the main camp, leaving puddles in his wake.

Michael turned back to the class. "Alright, who actually wants to try a proper dive? Jennifer, how about you?"

The spotlight moved away from me. I could breathe again. My hands unclenched from fists I hadn't realized I was making.

Jamie had seen me panic and saved me. At the cost of looking ridiculous and probably getting reported to Mrs. Morrison again. He'd taken the embarrassment so I wouldn't have to.

After class, I walked back to the cabins in a daze. Betty chattered about diving technique and how funny Jamie's belly-flop had been, but I barely heard her. I was thinking about the way Jamie had appeared at exactly the right moment, about the quiet words he'd said in passing, about the fact that he'd known I was terrified without me having to say anything.

~~~

I found the book on my bunk after lunch.

The Catcher in the Rye sat on my pillow, a piece of paper sticking out like a bookmark. My hands trembled slightly as I picked it up and unfolded the note.

*Saw you looking at this in Morrison's office during orientation. Borrowed it for you. -J*

The handwriting was messy, hurried, but the gesture made something warm unfold in my chest. He'd noticed what I wanted two weeks ago and remembered. He'd gotten it for me—stolen it, probably, knowing Jamie—and left it where I'd find it.

I pressed the note between the pages and held the book against my chest, smiling despite myself.

"What's that?" Betty appeared in the doorway, back from her own post-lunch activities.

"Just a book."

"Who's it from?" She had that knowing tone again, the one that suggested she was piecing together a story I hadn't admitted to yet.

"Jamie."

"Jamie gave you a book." She said it slowly, like she was testing the words. "Jamie Sullivan, who you claimed to hate two weeks ago, gave you a book he somehow knew you wanted."

"He's just—" I stopped, not sure how to explain. "We're friends, I guess. Maybe."

"Friends." Betty's expression was pure speculation. "Okay. Sure. Friends."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"Nothing!" But her grin said everything. "I just think it's nice. You and Jamie becoming friends. That's nice."

She left before I could argue, which was probably smart of her. I sat on my bunk, holding The Catcher in the Rye, reading the note over and over. The simple act of being noticed, being remembered, being thought of—it meant more than every minute I'd spent trying to catch Michael's attention.

The realization should have bothered me. I'd spent two weeks building a fantasy around Michael Grant, and now that fantasy felt empty compared to the reality of Jamie Sullivan seeing me.

~~~

Evening rec time usually found me reading alone while others played volleyball or worked on crafts. But tonight, I tucked The Catcher in the Rye under my arm and walked to where I'd seen Jamie earlier—the picnic tables near the mess hall where older campers gathered.

He was there with Sparky and two other boys, playing cards. When he saw me approaching, his expression shifted from surprised to pleased.

"Palmer." He said it like a greeting and a question at once.

"Sullivan." I sat down at the end of the bench, not joining their card game but close enough to be included if I wanted. "Thanks for the book."

"No problem. You looked pretty interested in it during orientation. Figured you'd get around to wanting it eventually."

"How did you get it? Mrs. Morrison keeps that office locked."

His grin was pure mischief. "A magician never reveals his secrets."

"You broke into her office."

"I borrowed from her office. There's a difference." He played a card that made Sparky groan. "You gonna read it now?"

"Maybe later." I opened the book to a random page, but I wasn't really reading. I was just... there. Existing in the same space as Jamie and his friends, comfortable enough to be quiet but not feeling invisible or excluded.

Sparky asked me a question about the scavenger hunt, whether we'd actually found a four-leaf clover or faked it. I answered, and that led to another question, and before I knew it, I was part of the conversation. Not performing or forcing anything—just talking.

Jamie watched me with something that looked like pride, like he'd known I could do this if I tried.

~~~

After the campfire that night—more songs, more marshmallows, more of Michael playing guitar in a way that felt pleasant but no longer made my heart race—I walked back to the cabins with Betty and the other girls from Cabin 7.

Except Jamie fell into step beside me halfway back, appearing from the darkness like he always did.

Betty and the others moved ahead, giving us space with the casual thoughtfulness of girls who'd decided they knew what was happening before I did.

We walked in comfortable silence for a while, the path illuminated by moonlight filtering through the pines. Finally, Jamie spoke.

"Do you like the book?"

"I haven't started it yet."

"Why not?"

I considered the question. "I wanted to thank you first."

"You already did."

"Not properly." I stopped walking, which made him stop too. We stood on the path, far enough from the cabins that no one could hear but close enough that I could see the lights through the trees. "Thank you for the book. And for the belly-flop this morning. And for last night on the dock. For seeing me when I was trying very hard not to be seen."

Jamie's expression in the moonlight was serious, vulnerable in the way it had been on the dock. "You're welcome. For all of it."

"We're really friends now, aren't we?"

"Yeah." He shoved his hands in his pockets, looking younger somehow. "If you're okay with that."

I thought about the past two weeks. About fighting and arguing and slowly, gradually learning to trust him. About shared spaces and shared truths. About the way he noticed things I tried to hide and cared about them anyway.

"I'm okay with that."

His smile was small and genuine and made something flutter in my chest that I absolutely was not going to examine right now.

"Good. See you tomorrow, Palmer."

"See you tomorrow, Sullivan."

I watched him walk toward the boys' cabins before continuing to Cabin 7. Betty was waiting on the porch, her expression far too knowing.

"Don't say it," I warned.

"I'm not saying anything!" But her grin said everything.

~~~

That night, in my bunk with The Catcher in the Rye unopened beside me, I took inventory of my day.

I'd looked for Jamie at breakfast instead of for Michael. I'd thought about Jamie's sacrifice during swimming instead of about Michael's demonstration. I'd sought out Jamie's company during rec time instead of watching Michael from a distance. I'd walked with Jamie in the darkness and felt more present, more real, more seen than I'd felt in Michael's vicinity all week.

The crush that had defined my first two weeks at Camp Silver Lake—the safe, fantasy crush on the unattainable counselor—felt like something from another girl's life. That girl who'd arrived planning to hide and count days until she could go home.

This girl, lying in her bunk on her ninth night at camp, was different. This girl had a friend who saw through her invisibility act and wouldn't let her hide. This girl had laughed during a scavenger hunt and sat by rocks reading while someone drew and talked on a dock about real things.

This girl was still scared—maybe more scared than before, because Jamie was real in a way Michael never could have been. Michael was safe precisely because he was impossible. Jamie was terrifying because he was right here, seeing her, knowing her, and apparently deciding she was worth the effort of friendship.

That thought should have sent me running. Should have made me close off, disappear back into books and silence and the comfortable numbness of invisibility.

Instead, it made me pick up The Catcher in the Rye and open to the first page.

*If you really want to hear about it...*

I read until lights-out, then by flashlight for another hour, Jamie's note still marking the middle of the book where I'd found it. When I finally slept, I dreamed about starlight on water and someone who kept showing up exactly when I needed him, even when I didn't know I needed him.

Especially then.
