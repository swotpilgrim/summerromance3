# Chapter 1: The Reluctant Arrival

I pressed my forehead against the warm glass of the station wagon's back window and watched Michigan pine trees blur past in endless green rows. My suitcase sat beside me on the vinyl seat, and I kept one hand on it like it might try to escape—which made one of us. Inside that battered case were the only friends I'd need for the next eight weeks: Jane Eyre, Pride and Prejudice, The Secret Garden, and four others I'd selected as carefully as someone preparing for exile.

"You missed the turn, Harold." My mother's voice had that tight, controlled quality I knew too well.

"I didn't miss it. The sign said two miles." My father's hands gripped the steering wheel a little harder.

"The sign said two miles three miles ago."

"Well, maybe you should drive then, Margaret."

I closed my eyes and counted. Fifty-six days. Eight weeks. One thousand three hundred and forty-four hours until I could go home. Not that home was much better than wherever we were going, but at least at home I had my room, my books, my routines. I knew which floorboards creaked, which hours my parents fought the loudest, where to hide.

Camp Silver Lake. The name sounded cheerful and innocent, like something from a happy family's vacation. My parents had presented it as an opportunity—"You'll make friends, honey" and "Fresh air will do you good" and "You spend too much time alone." What they meant was: we need a break from having to pretend we're a happy family. Eight weeks without their quiet daughter who noticed everything and said nothing.

The station wagon finally turned onto a dirt road marked by a wooden sign: WELCOME TO CAMP SILVER LAKE. My stomach knotted. Through the trees ahead, I could hear it—the chaos of arrival. Girls shrieking reunion greetings, car doors slamming, counselors shouting directions that no one followed.

We rounded the final curve and the scene before me looked like something from a movie, except I wasn't the star. I was one of the nameless extras in the background. Dozens of girls swarmed around the parking area, all of them seeming to know each other already. They wore bright summer dresses and bobby socks, their hair perfectly curled or pulled into high ponytails. They hugged and laughed and dragged trunks covered in stickers from previous summers at other perfect camps.

I clutched my suitcase tighter.

"Now, Lily, you packed enough socks, right?" My mother twisted in her seat to look at me. "It gets cold at night by the lake. Did you pack your blue cardigan? And your—"

"I packed everything on the list." My voice came out quieter than I intended. It usually did.

"Your mother's just worried about you, sweetheart." My father checked his watch. The gesture was habitual, reflexive. Time to be somewhere else. Always time to be somewhere else.

They walked me to the check-in table, my mother fussing with my collar while my father scanned the area with the distracted air of someone calculating the fastest escape route. A counselor with a clipboard—NANCY, her name tag read—checked me off a list and pointed toward a cluster of cabins visible through the pines.

"You're in Cabin 7, Pine Grove section. Someone will help you with your trunk." Nancy's smile was bright and practiced. "Welcome to Camp Silver Lake!"

My parents kissed me quickly. My mother reminded me to write every week. My father told me to have fun, as if that were something I could simply decide to do. Then they were climbing back into the station wagon, and I watched it disappear down the dirt road, taking with it the last remnants of the familiar.

I stood alone with my suitcase and the trunk the camp had sent ahead, feeling the weight of being completely visible and utterly invisible at the same time. Around me, girls called to each other by name, compared tan lines from other vacations, showed off new summer wardrobes. No one looked at me. I was good at this—at being the person no one noticed. But usually, I chose to be invisible. Here, surrounded by all this bright, loud energy, the invisibility felt different. It felt lonely.

"You must be Lily!"

The voice was cheerful in a way that should have been annoying but somehow wasn't. I turned to find a blonde girl with bright blue eyes and a smile that looked genuinely happy. She wore pink capri pants and a white blouse with the collar turned up, and she looked exactly like the kind of girl who'd never understand what it was like to be me.

"I'm Betty Wilson. We're cabin-mates!" She grabbed one end of my trunk without asking. "Come on, I'll show you the way. This is my third summer at Silver Lake. You're going to love it. Well, most of it. The food's pretty terrible, but there's always peanut butter sandwiches if you get desperate. Do you like swimming? Please say you like swimming because that's basically all we do in the morning, and it's more fun if your cabin-mates don't hate it. Oh, and the counselors are swell, mostly. Mrs. Morrison is strict about lights-out, but she's fair..."

Betty chattered the entire walk to Cabin 7, and I realized she didn't actually need responses. She was a one-person conversation, filling silence the way I usually filled it with books. Somehow, that made it easier. I could just follow along, carrying my suitcase, letting her words wash over me like a radio program in another room.

The cabin appeared through the pine trees—a wooden structure raised slightly off the ground, with screen windows and a door that stood propped open. Inside, controlled chaos reigned. Four other girls had already claimed their spaces, and they turned to assess the newcomers with the quick, calculating glances of teenage girls measuring competition and potential friendship.

"This is Lily Palmer," Betty announced, as if I were someone worth announcing. "She's new. Lily, that's Sandra, Maria, Jennifer, and Ruth."

They offered various versions of hello before returning to their unpacking and the conversation I'd interrupted. Something about which counselors were cute and whether the boys' camp across the lake did a joint dance this year. I caught fragments—"Michael Grant is back" and "dreamy" and "but he's too old for us"—before tuning out.

Betty led me to the back corner where two bunks remained unclaimed. "I like the bottom because I roll around at night and I'm afraid I'll fall out of the top. But if you want bottom, I can—"

"Top is fine." Perfect, actually. Higher meant farther from the activity. More separate. I could lie there and pretend I was somewhere else entirely.

I climbed up with my suitcase and began the ritual of unpacking. My clothes went into the small built-in cubbies, functional and few. But my books—those I arranged on the narrow shelf above my pillow with the care of someone setting up a shrine. Jane Eyre first, because I was near the end and wanted to finish it soon. Then Pride and Prejudice, The Secret Garden, Wuthering Heights, Little Women, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and Anne of Green Gables. My mother said I read the same books over and over. She didn't understand that was the point. These books were safe. I knew how they ended. No surprises, no disappointments.

"Wow, you really like to read, huh?" Betty's voice came from below.

"Yes." I smoothed my hand over Jane Eyre's worn cover.

"That's neat. I like reading too, but I never remember to bring books to camp. Too much other stuff to do. Maybe I can borrow one sometime?"

"Maybe." I didn't point out that lending books felt like lending pieces of myself. She seemed nice, this Betty Wilson. I didn't want to offend her in the first ten minutes.

Below me, the other girls continued their preparations. Sandra was pinning up photographs of what must have been friends from home—everyone smiling at the camera, arms around each other. Maria was arranging bottles and jars on her shelf, more cosmetics than I'd ever owned in my life. Jennifer and Ruth were already dressed in matching swimming suits, comparing notes about swimming ability and debating whether they should sign up for advanced or intermediate lessons.

I pulled out my plain cotton nightgown and my one nice dress for whatever formal dinners or events might be required. Everything else was practical—shorts, blouses, dungarees, saddle shoes, bobby socks. My mother had tried to get me to buy something pretty, something with more color, but I'd chosen things that would let me blend in. Grey. Blue. White. Colors that said nothing.

"Hey, everyone!" A counselor appeared in the doorway—late twenties, with her hair pulled back and a whistle around her neck. "I'm Miss Patterson, your cabin counselor. Orientation meeting in the mess hall starts in twenty minutes. Don't be late—Mrs. Morrison notices everything. Dress code is neat and clean, nothing fancy."

The announcement sent the cabin into motion. Girls changed shirts, fixed hair, added lipstick that probably wasn't technically allowed but looked natural enough to pass. Betty pulled on a fresh yellow blouse that made her look like sunshine. I stayed in what I was wearing—a plain blue blouse and tan shorts—and climbed down from my bunk, Jane Eyre tucked under my arm.

"You're bringing a book to orientation?" Betty asked, not meanly, just curious.

"Just in case." In case of what, I couldn't quite explain. In case I needed armor. In case I needed somewhere to look that wasn't at all the girls who belonged here while I didn't. In case I needed a reminder that somewhere, in some story, girls like Jane found their place in the world.

We joined the stream of campers heading toward the mess hall, a larger building near the lake. Through breaks in the trees, I caught glimpses of water—wide and blue and dotted with canoes. It was beautiful in a way I hadn't expected. The pine scent in the warm June air, the sound of water lapping at docks, the way sunlight filtered through the trees in golden shafts. If I'd been alone, it might have been peaceful.

But I wasn't alone. I was surrounded by dozens of girls who all seemed to know how to be here, how to belong, how to take up space without apology. And I was me—Lily Palmer, the quiet girl, the invisible girl, the girl who lived in books because real life was too loud and unpredictable and likely to hurt.

I made a silent deal with myself as we approached the mess hall: Survive eight weeks. Stay invisible. Don't get hurt. Read, count the days, and get through this.

Behind me, Betty was already making friends with girls from another cabin. Ahead, the mess hall doors stood open, and I could hear the low roar of a hundred girls gathering in one space. My hand tightened on Jane Eyre's cover.

Eight weeks. I could survive anything for eight weeks.

I took a breath and walked through the doors into the noise, already planning where I could sit that would attract the least attention. The back corner, probably. Against the wall. Somewhere I could observe without being observed.

Somewhere safe.
