# Chapter 19: Jamie's Hidden Depths

Two days before the talent show, I caught Jamie sneaking out of the arts and crafts building well after hours.

I'd been walking back from a late lighting check at the mess hall when I saw him slip through the door, carrying something wrapped in cloth with the careful protectiveness I'd come to associate with his secret project. The building was supposed to be locked after dinner, but Jamie had ways around rules—had always had ways around rules.

He saw me and froze, caught.

"Palmer. Hey. What are you doing out here?"

"Final lighting adjustments. What are you doing breaking into buildings after hours?"

"I prefer to think of it as creative use of available resources." But his cocky grin didn't quite reach his eyes. He looked nervous, uncertain—expressions that sat strangely on Jamie Sullivan's face.

"Is that your book?" I gestured to the wrapped bundle.

"Yeah. I was adding something. One last piece for the performance." He shifted his weight, the cloth-wrapped book held carefully against his chest. "Want to see?"

"Really?"

"Yeah. Come on."

He led me back into the arts and crafts building, flipping on a single overhead light that cast the room in warm yellow glow. Craft supplies lined the shelves—paint bottles, brushes, spools of lanyard string, leather-working tools. The smell of glue and paint and creativity hung in the air.

Jamie unwrapped the book on one of the tables, opening it to pages I hadn't seen before. New pages, recently added, still smelling faintly of binding glue.

"I added three more stories tonight," he said, his voice quiet. "Wanted to finish it properly. To bring it all the way through to now instead of stopping at random."

I looked at the pages. The first new story was about a boy and a girl who fought because they told each other truths that hurt, and about how repairing damage was harder than preventing it but worth the effort. The accompanying sketch showed two figures on a dock at night, sitting apart but facing each other.

The second story was about letting go of safe fantasies to make room for scary realities. Its illustration was more abstract—a book falling open with pages transforming into birds.

The third story didn't have a title yet. The text was about summer ending and wondering what happened to connections made in temporary places. Whether they could survive returning to real life or if they only worked in the suspended reality of camp.

"Jamie," I said, my voice rough. "These are beautiful. And sad. Especially this last one."

"Yeah." He stared at the pages. "I've been thinking about that a lot. In two weeks, we all go home. You back to your life, me back to mine. And I'm not sure what happens to... to this." He gestured vaguely between us. "To what we've built here."

The words hung in the air, heavy with meaning. I'd been avoiding thinking about the end of summer, about what happened when camp ended and we returned to being regular teenagers in different towns. About whether the friendship—or whatever this was becoming—could survive in the real world.

"I don't know either," I admitted. "I want to say we'll write letters and stay friends and it'll be fine. But I'm scared it won't be. That camp is its own universe and we only work here."

Jamie nodded slowly. "That's what the story's about. The uncertainty. The hope mixed with fear." He closed the book carefully. "I'm not sure how to end it. Don't know what the right conclusion is yet."

"Maybe you write the ending after we know how it turns out?"

"Maybe." He rewrapped the book in its protective cloth. "Two days until I have to perform this. I keep almost changing my mind—going back to something safer, something more like what people expect from me."

"But you're not going to."

"No. I'm not." He smiled, small and determined. "I spent the whole summer telling you to stop hiding behind safe fantasies. Would be pretty hypocritical to hide behind my safe troublemaker act when I have a chance to show people something real."

I moved closer, resting my hand on his arm. "You're going to be amazing. Everyone's expecting Jamie Sullivan chaos, and they're going to get Jamie Sullivan truth instead. It's going to blow them away."

He looked at my hand on his arm, then at my face, something shifting in his expression. "You really believe that?"

"Completely."

"Even though I'm terrified I'll get up there and freeze? Or that I'll read the story and everyone will just sit there in confused silence because they don't understand what I'm trying to say?"

"Even then. But that's not going to happen. The stories are beautiful. The art is beautiful. People will understand because you're being genuinely yourself, and that's always more powerful than any performance."

Jamie was quiet for a moment. "When did you get so wise, Palmer?"

"I'm learning from someone who refuses to let me hide from hard truths."

He laughed, the sound more relaxed now. "Fair enough." He picked up the wrapped book. "Come on, we should get back before someone does actual cabin checks and realizes we're missing."

We walked back through the darkened camp, the summer night perfect around us—warm air, cricket songs, the distant sound of the lake. Jamie walked close enough that our arms brushed occasionally, and neither of us moved away.

"Can I tell you something?" he asked as we neared the path that would split toward our separate cabin areas.

"Always."

"I'm glad you came to camp this summer. Glad you sat on that dock with your book so I could cannonball and soak you." His tone was light, but something in it felt serious. "Even though we fought and said terrible things and made each other miserable for a few days—I'm glad it all happened."

"Me too." The words felt insufficient for what I meant, but they were true. "You made this summer bearable. More than bearable—actually good. When I showed up, I was planning to hide for eight weeks and count days. But you wouldn't let me hide."

"Couldn't help it. You're interesting when you stop trying to disappear."

We'd reached the fork. Usually this was where we said goodnight and went our separate ways. But tonight Jamie didn't immediately turn toward the boys' cabins. He stood there, the wrapped book still in his hands, looking at me with an expression I couldn't quite read in the darkness.

"Lily?" Using my first name instead of "Palmer"—he only did that when he was being serious.

"Yeah?"

"After the talent show, after the summer ends—I want to try to stay in touch. Real stay in touch, not just promises we make and forget. Letters, phone calls when we can afford them, maybe visits if the distance isn't too far." He said it in a rush, like he'd been holding it back. "I know we don't know what this is between us or where it's going, but I know I don't want to lose it just because camp ends."

My heart hammered in my chest. "I don't want to lose it either."

"Okay. Good." He smiled, relief clear even in the dim light. "We'll figure it out then. However it needs to work."

"Yeah. We'll figure it out."

He raised his hand in a small wave, then headed toward the boys' cabins. I watched him disappear into the darkness before turning toward my own cabin, my mind spinning with the implications of what he'd said.

*I don't want to lose it just because camp ends.*

Neither did I. The thought of going home and never seeing Jamie again, of losing the person who'd seen me most clearly this summer, made my chest ache.

Betty was already asleep when I climbed into my bunk, but I lay awake for a long time thinking. About Jamie's new stories, especially the unfinished one about not knowing whether camp connections survived in the real world. About his nervousness for the talent show performance. About him wanting to stay in touch after summer ended.

About how much I wanted that too.

The next day, the camp buzzed with talent show energy. Final rehearsals, last-minute costume decisions, nervous performers running through their acts one more time. I spent the afternoon at my lighting station, running through cues until I could do them in my sleep.

Dorothy finished her backdrop and stepped back to survey it with satisfaction. "What do you think?" she asked me.

"It's beautiful. Really beautiful."

"Thanks! I'm pleased with how it turned out." She started cleaning her brushes. "You know, it's been really nice working with you this summer. You're so competent and calm—makes the whole process less stressful."

The compliment warmed me. "Thanks. I've enjoyed it too."

Michael appeared, reviewing his final director notes. "Ladies, we're almost there. Tomorrow night, all this work pays off." He looked at Dorothy with undisguised affection. "Your set is going to make everything look amazing, Dor."

"Team effort," she said, squeezing his hand. "We all made it work."

I watched their casual intimacy—the hand squeeze, the warm glances, the comfortable partnership. A few weeks ago, it would have hurt. Now it just felt observational. They fit together well. Good for them.

After they left to attend a counselor meeting, I sat alone at my lighting station, reviewing my cue sheet one final time. The mess hall felt different in the empty quiet—full of potential, waiting to transform into something magical tomorrow night.

"Hiding or practicing?"

I looked up to find Jamie in the doorway, hands in his pockets, that uncertain expression still on his face.

"Practicing. You?"

"Avoiding. If I think too hard about tomorrow, I'll convince myself to back out." He walked toward my station. "Mind if I keep you company while you practice?"

"Not at all."

He sat on the edge of a nearby table while I ran through cues. We didn't talk much—just existed in the same space, comfortable in our usual silence. But I was aware of him watching, of his presence making the empty mess hall feel less lonely.

After I'd finished my practice runs, I packed up my cue sheets and turned off the stage lights. Jamie walked back to the cabins with me, neither of us in a hurry despite the approaching dinner bell.

"You ready for tomorrow?" I asked.

"No. But I'm doing it anyway." He smiled slightly. "That's brave, right? Doing the scary thing even when you're terrified?"

"That's the definition of brave."

We walked in silence for a while. Then Jamie said quietly, "Thank you."

"For what?"

"For being the person I could show the book to first. For understanding what it was. For making me believe it was worth sharing." He looked at me, and something in his expression made my breath catch. "For seeing me, Lily. Really seeing me. That's meant more than I know how to say."

I stopped walking, turning to face him fully. "You saw me first. Wouldn't let me hide even when I desperately wanted to. Everything that's different about this summer—all the good parts—came from you refusing to let me be invisible."

"We kind of saved each other a little bit, didn't we?"

"Yeah. We really did."

We stood there on the path, the summer evening perfect around us, looking at each other with something that felt bigger than friendship but that neither of us was quite ready to name.

Tomorrow was the talent show. Then two weeks until summer ended. Not enough time to figure everything out, but maybe enough time to start.

"See you at the performance," Jamie said finally.

"I'll be right there. Running your lights and cheering you on."

"That's all I need."

He headed toward his cabin, and I watched him go, thinking about courage and vulnerability and boys who created beautiful things out of the messiness of real connection.

That night in my bunk, I pulled out *To Kill a Mockingbird* and found Jamie's note still pressed between the pages. *I'm sorry. I was a jerk about how I said it, even if I wasn't wrong about what I said. You don't have to forgive me, but I miss talking to you.*

Simple words that had cracked open a door I'd thought I'd sealed shut.

Tomorrow he'd stand on stage and share his real self with everyone. And I'd be there, watching from my lighting station, proud of his courage and grateful that he'd chosen to share it with me first.

Whatever happened after—whatever form our connection took when camp ended and real life resumed—I knew this summer had changed me fundamentally. I'd arrived wanting to hide, and I was leaving knowing that being seen by the right person was worth all the risk.

I fell asleep with the book on my chest and hope in my heart, ready for tomorrow to see what happened when Jamie Sullivan stopped performing and showed everyone who he really was.

Ready to see what happened when we both stopped hiding.
