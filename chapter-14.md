# Chapter 14: The Long Silence

Four days.

Four days of successfully avoiding each other in a space where three hundred people lived in close quarters. It should have been impossible, but Jamie and I managed it through what must have been coordinated effort on both sides.

I'd mastered the art of being elsewhere. Different tables for meals, different paths between activities, abandoning our shared reading spot entirely because the thought of going there made my chest ache. I threw myself into the routine of camp—swimming lessons, crafts, evening activities—going through the motions while feeling increasingly hollow.

I told myself I was fine. Told myself I didn't need Jamie's friendship or his unsolicited opinions about my life. Told myself that the loneliness I felt was just what I'd wanted from the beginning anyway—to be left alone, to be invisible, to count days until I could go home.

The lies didn't stick, but I kept telling them anyway.

On the fourth morning, I woke to rain drumming against the cabin roof. Heavy, persistent summer rain that would cancel outdoor activities and trap us all indoors. The other girls groaned at the weather, but I felt a strange relief. Rainy day meant organized indoor games, cabin time, the kind of structured chaos where it was easy to disappear into corners.

"Rest period until the rain stops," Miss Patterson announced after breakfast. "Stay in your cabins, read, write letters, play quiet games. No running around."

The girls from Cabin 7 scattered to their bunks, pulling out magazines and stationery and card games. Betty asked if I wanted to play gin rummy with her and Sandra. I declined, pulling out writing paper instead.

"Letter home?" Betty asked.

"Yeah."

I'd been writing the same letter in my head for days—unsent words I couldn't actually put down because what would I say? *Dear Mom and Dad, I came to camp planning to hide for eight weeks, but someone saw me anyway and I destroyed that friendship because he told me truths I didn't want to hear. How's your summer going?*

I stared at the blank paper for a long time before writing the lies they'd expect:

*Dear Mom and Dad,*

*Camp is going well. I've improved at swimming. I've made a friend named Betty who's very nice. The weather has been mostly beautiful, though today it's raining.*

*Hope you're both well.*

*Love, Lily*

Generic. Forgettable. The kind of letter that revealed nothing true.

I set it aside to mail later—or maybe I'd throw it away. I lay back on my bunk, staring at the cabin ceiling while rain pattered overhead and the other girls chatted and laughed around me.

"Lily?" Betty's voice came from below. "Can I ask you something?"

"Sure."

"What happened with you and Jamie? And please don't say 'nothing' again, because you've both been miserable for days and everyone's noticed."

I closed my eyes. "He was being overbearing. Judging my choices."

"That doesn't sound like Jamie."

"You don't know him like I do." The words came out sharper than intended.

"Maybe not. But I know he's been looking as miserable as you these past days. Sandra saw him at breakfast this morning—said he looked awful. Not sleeping, barely eating."

The information shouldn't have affected me, but something twisted in my chest. "That's not my problem."

"Isn't it though?" Betty's voice was gentle but persistent. "I saw you two becoming friends. Real friends. I saw how he looked at you, how you looked at him when you thought no one was watching. Whatever happened between you, it must have been pretty bad to make you both this unhappy."

"He said cruel things. About me, about my choices."

"Did you say cruel things back?"

I didn't answer. The silence was answer enough.

Betty sighed. "Maybe it's worth fixing? Whatever happened, I mean. Because from where I'm sitting, you had something good and you're both suffering without it."

"He won't want to fix it. He told me he was done trying to care about what I do."

"And you believed him?"

The question hung in the rainy air. I didn't have an answer.

The rain continued through lunch, through the afternoon. I sat on my bunk with Pride and Prejudice—the comfort of Elizabeth Bennet's world, where people said cutting things in elegant language but everything worked out in the end.

Except I couldn't focus on the words. I kept thinking about Jamie. About the rain making everything gray and dreary, about whether he was holed up in his cabin too, about whether he was as miserable as Betty said.

About whether he regretted our fight as much as I did.

From my top bunk, I could see out the window toward the main camp buildings. Through the rain, I glimpsed someone walking alone near the reading spot—our spot. Even at this distance, even through the gray curtain of rain, I recognized the silhouette.

Jamie.

He stood there for a long moment, just looking at the rocks where we'd sat together, drawn together, become friends. Then he turned and walked away, shoulders hunched against the weather.

Something in my chest cracked wider.

~~~

That evening, the rain finally stopped, leaving the camp smelling of wet pine and earth. Counselors organized an impromptu campfire despite the damp ground, needing to burn off the energy of campers who'd been cooped up all day.

I went because attendance was mandatory, but I sat at the very back, far from the warmth of the fire. Betty and the other girls gave me space, sensing I needed it.

The flames crackled, sending sparks into the twilight sky. Girls roasted marshmallows and sang songs, the usual camp bonding that had started to feel almost comfortable before everything fell apart with Jamie.

I saw him across the fire, sitting with Sparky. But he wasn't his usual animated self—no jokes, no elaborate stories, no commandeering attention. He just sat there, picking at a marshmallow on a stick, staring into the flames with an expression I'd never seen on him before.

Defeated. Lost.

Because of me. Because I'd used his deepest wounds as weapons. Because I'd proven that letting people see you really did end in being hurt.

Sparky leaned over and said something to Jamie. Jamie shook his head, stood up, and walked away from the fire into the darkness. Sparky watched him go with a worried expression.

"He's been like that for days," someone said nearby. I turned to see two boys from Jamie's cabin talking quietly. "Won't talk to anyone but Sparky, barely leaves his bunk except for mandatory stuff. Did you hear what happened?"

"Something with that quiet girl he was hanging around. Palmer? Something like that. Sparky said they had a major fight."

"That sucks. Jamie's annoying but he's been different lately. Less chaos, more... I don't know. Human?"

They moved on to other topics, but I sat frozen, their words echoing. *He's been different lately. Less chaos, more human.*

Because of me. I'd helped Jamie drop some of his defensive performance. I'd given him a safe space to be vulnerable, to share his art, to talk about real things.

And then I'd destroyed it completely.

~~~

The walk back to cabins happened in quiet groups, flashlights cutting through the damp darkness. I lagged behind, in no hurry to reach my bunk and the thoughts that would keep me awake.

At the fork where paths split toward different cabin sections, I saw Jamie walking alone ahead. He must have taken a different route from the campfire, avoiding the crowds.

I watched him disappear into the darkness, and something in me wanted to call out. To apologize. To try to fix what I'd broken.

But I didn't. I didn't know how to start, didn't know if he'd even want to hear it, didn't know if sorry could undo the damage I'd done.

In Cabin 7, the other girls prepared for bed with the usual chatter about the day, about boys at the boys' camp, about plans for tomorrow's activities. I lay in my bunk, staring at the ceiling, listening to their easy friendship and feeling utterly alone.

Four days ago, I'd had something real. Someone who saw me, understood me, challenged me. Someone who'd shared his own vulnerabilities in the trust that I'd handle them with care.

And I'd thrown it all away because he'd told me truths that hurt.

*You're hiding behind a fantasy. You're too scared to be seen. You deserve someone who actually notices you.*

All true. All painful. All said because he cared enough to be honest.

And I'd responded by weaponizing his pain about his parents.

The thought made me squeeze my eyes shut against tears that wanted to fall. I'd come to camp planning to hide, to be invisible, to protect myself from being hurt.

Instead, I'd done all the hurting. And the person I'd hurt most was the one who'd tried hardest to see me.

Betty climbed into the bunk below, her weight making the whole structure creak slightly. "You okay up there?"

"No," I whispered. The honest answer surprised me.

"Want to talk about it?"

"I don't know how to fix it."

"Have you tried apologizing?"

"He won't want to hear it. I went too far, Betty. I said something really cruel. About his family, about why he's at camp..." My voice cracked. "I used something he told me in confidence as a weapon."

Betty was quiet for a moment. "That's pretty bad."

"I know."

"But maybe try anyway? The worst that happens is he doesn't forgive you, and you're already at worst. But maybe—maybe he's been just as miserable and wants to fix it too."

I thought about Jamie standing in the rain by our reading spot. About him walking away from the campfire looking defeated. About four days of mutual avoidance that had left us both hollow.

"Maybe," I said, though I didn't believe it.

I lay awake long after lights-out, listening to the gentle chorus of sleeping girls and the distant sounds of the lake. Tomorrow was day five. Then six. Then seven. The summer was half over, and I'd spent the last four days proving Jamie right about everything.

I was hiding. From him, from Michael's obvious disinterest, from the truth about what I really wanted and who I really was.

And hiding wasn't keeping me safe anymore. It was just making me lonely.

The realization sat heavy in my chest, undeniable and uncomfortable. I'd run from the fight Jamie had picked because his words forced me to look at things I didn't want to see. But four days of silence hadn't made those truths go away.

They'd just made everything worse.

I reached for The Catcher in the Rye on my shelf, running my fingers over the cover Jamie had secured for me. The book he'd noticed me wanting from across a crowded room two weeks into camp. The thoughtfulness that showed he paid attention when it would have been easier not to.

Tomorrow, I decided in the darkness. Tomorrow I'd try to fix this. Even if he didn't want to hear it. Even if sorry wasn't enough. Even if I'd destroyed something that couldn't be repaired.

Because Betty was right—I was already at worst. The only direction left was trying.

The thought didn't make sleep come easier, but it was something. A small seed of maybe in the wasteland I'd created.

I held onto it and waited for morning.
