# Chapter 8: The Great Scavenger Hunt

The scavenger hunt team assignments appeared on the mess hall bulletin board during breakfast, and the entire camp crowded around to see who they'd been paired with. I hung back with my toast and jam, waiting for the chaos to die down before checking. Knowing my luck, I'd be partnered with someone who actually expected me to be social and enthusiastic.

Betty fought her way back through the crowd, grinning. "I got paired with Sarah from Cabin 4! She's really nice. Who'd you get?"

"I haven't looked yet."

"Come on, let's check together."

She dragged me to the board, now surrounded by only a handful of stragglers. I scanned the list for my name, found it, and felt my stomach sink.

**Team 14: Lily Palmer & Jamie Sullivan**

"Oh," Betty said, reading over my shoulder. She tried to sound encouraging. "That could be... fun?"

I looked across the mess hall to where Jamie sat with Sparky, both of them studying what must have been their own team assignments. As if sensing my stare, Jamie looked up. Our eyes met. His expression shifted from neutral to something that might have been amusement—or resignation. Hard to tell from this distance.

"I'm sorry," Betty whispered. "At least it's only a few hours?"

Mrs. Morrison stood on a chair—actually stood on a chair, which was surprising for a woman in her fifties—and called for attention. "Campers! The annual Camp Silver Lake scavenger hunt begins in thirty minutes. You have two hours to complete as many challenges as possible. Teams, find your partners. Rules and item lists will be distributed at the starting line by the main flag. Good luck, and remember—creativity is encouraged, vandalism is not!"

I gathered my breakfast dishes and headed for the kitchen drop-off, trying to delay the inevitable moment when I'd have to actually talk to Jamie about this. But he found me before I could escape.

"Palmer." He appeared at my elbow, holding his own breakfast tray. "Looks like we're partners."

"Looks like."

"You don't seem thrilled."

"Are you thrilled?"

He considered this. "I'm intrigued. You're very organized and I'm very good at bending rules. Could be an interesting combination."

"Or a disaster."

"That too." He grinned. "Come on, we should strategize. Meet at the flagpole in twenty minutes?"

I wanted to say no, wanted to ask Mrs. Morrison if I could sit this one out, wanted to be anywhere but partnered with Jamie Sullivan for two hours of forced cooperation. But the look on his face wasn't his usual smirk. He looked almost... hopeful? Like maybe he thought this could actually be fun?

"Fine. Twenty minutes."

~~~

The flagpole area was chaos when I arrived—exactly on time, because being late felt like giving Jamie ammunition. He was already there, bouncing on the balls of his feet like he had excess energy to burn. When he saw me, he waved me over.

"Got a preview of the challenge list from Sparky, who got it from his sister who helped Mrs. Morrison plan this thing." He pulled a crumpled paper from his pocket. "We need to find: a counselor's sock, a pine cone with exactly ten scales, a photo of both of us doing a handstand, a pressed four-leaf clover, and we have to solve riddles at three checkpoints to get the final location."

"That's cheating. Knowing the list early is cheating."

"It's called strategic intelligence gathering." He stuffed the paper back in his pocket as Mrs. Morrison approached with official lists for all teams. "Besides, everyone's cheating in their own way. Sarah's brother was a counselor here last year—he knows all the good hiding spots. The twins from Cabin 3 are tiny and can fit places we can't. We've got advance knowledge. That's our advantage."

I wanted to argue more, but Mrs. Morrison was distributing lists and explaining rules. Teams scattered immediately, some running toward the cabins, others toward the woods, everyone with their own strategy.

"Okay," Jamie said, studying the official list. "I say we hit the counselor cabin first, get the sock while everyone else is scrambling for easy stuff."

"That's breaking and entering."

"It's visiting. We'll knock." He was already walking toward the counselor cabins. "Come on, Palmer. Clock's ticking."

I followed because what else was I going to do? Stand at the flagpole and forfeit? Betty would ask questions, and I didn't have good answers.

Jamie's plan for the counselor sock involved knocking on the girls' counselor cabin and asking Miss Hayes if she had any old socks she didn't want. Straightforward. Legal. She laughed and gave us a striped sock from her laundry bag, wishing us luck.

"See?" Jamie said as we left. "Not breaking and entering. Just asking nicely."

"I'm surprised you know how to ask nicely."

"I contain multitudes, Palmer."

We tackled the pine cone challenge next. Jamie wanted to grab the first ten-scale cone we saw and move on. I insisted we had to count carefully because losing points for the wrong cone would waste more time than finding the right one.

"You count," he said, climbing a tree to shake down cones from a higher branch. "I'll provide inventory."

So I sat on the ground, counting scales on pine cone after pine cone while Jamie climbed around above me like a squirrel, shaking branches and providing running commentary about the view and how he could see three other teams from up there.

"This one!" I held up cone number seventeen. "Exactly ten scales."

"Finally." He dropped from the tree, landing easily beside me. "What's next?"

The handstand photo required creativity and someone with a camera. We found a counselor with a Polaroid at the crafts building and convinced him to photograph us both attempting handstands against the mess hall wall. I could hold a handstand for maybe three seconds. Jamie could hold one indefinitely, the showoff.

The photo developed slowly, the image emerging like magic. Jamie took it and waved it to help it dry. "We look ridiculous. I love it."

He was right—we did look ridiculous. I was mid-collapse in the photo, one leg up, one leg down, face scrunched in concentration. Jamie was perfectly vertical beside me, grinning even upside down.

"Next is the riddle checkpoints," I said, consulting the list. "First one is 'Where the water meets the wood and swimmers leave their shoes.'"

"The dock!" we said simultaneously, then looked at each other in surprise.

We ran. I didn't even think about it—just ran, Jamie keeping pace beside me, both of us racing to beat other teams to the checkpoint. We arrived breathless and found Mr. Davidson with the next riddle.

"'Where flames dance and songs rise, friendship circles beneath the skies,'" he read.

"Campfire pit," I said immediately.

"Show-off," Jamie grinned, but he looked impressed.

The campfire pit checkpoint gave us another riddle that led to the nature building, where we had to identify three types of leaves correctly to get the final challenge: the four-leaf clover.

"That's impossible," I said, staring at the massive field of clover behind the nature building. "We'll never find one in time."

"Not with that attitude." Jamie was already on his hands and knees, crawling through the clover. "You take that section, I'll take this one. Look for asymmetry—four-leaf clovers stick out because they're different."

"That's actually smart."

"Don't sound so surprised."

We searched in silence, the sun hot on our backs, the timer ticking down. Other teams ran past us toward different challenges. I heard someone shriek about finding their clover, which made me search faster, more desperately.

My eyes started to blur, all the clover looking the same. Three leaves, three leaves, three leaves, three—

"Four!" I lunged for it, cradling the tiny plant like it was made of gold. "Jamie, I found one!"

He appeared beside me immediately. "You're sure?"

"Count them!"

He counted, touching each leaf gently. "That's four, Palmer. That's definitely four." He looked at me, and his grin was huge and genuine. "We've got everything. Come on!"

We ran back to the flagpole where Mrs. Morrison was timing teams. "Team 14, checking in!"

She examined our items: sock, pine cone, photo, pressed clover (Jamie had thought to bring paper to press it), completed riddles. "Everything checks out. Time: one hour, forty-two minutes. That's our fastest team so far."

Other teams were still trickling in, some missing items, some having given up. Betty and Sarah arrived ten minutes later, laughing and disheveled, missing the four-leaf clover.

When Mrs. Morrison finally announced the winner at lunch, it was official: Team 14—Lily Palmer and Jamie Sullivan—first place. The prize was extra dessert privileges for a week, which seemed anticlimactic given the effort, but Jamie accepted it with an elaborate bow that made people laugh.

"Good job, partner," he said, holding up his hand for a high-five.

I hesitated, then slapped his palm. His hand was warm and calloused from climbing trees and swimming and whatever else he did with his time. The contact lasted a fraction of a second but somehow felt significant.

"You weren't completely terrible at that," I admitted.

"I'll take it. You weren't bad yourself. Very methodical. Good at riddles. Excellent at handstands." He paused. "Okay, terrible at handstands, but you tried."

"I lasted three seconds!"

"I'm not judging. Much." But he was smiling, and it wasn't his cocky troublemaker smile. It was something softer, more real. "We made a good team."

We had. That was the unsettling part. His chaos and my organization had complemented each other. His boldness to knock on the counselor door, my patience to count pine cones. His tree-climbing ability, my riddle-solving. We'd worked together smoothly, reading each other's strengths, compensating for weaknesses.

Betty found me after lunch. "You and Jamie won! That's amazing!"

"We got lucky."

"Sarah said you guys worked together really well. She said it looked like you'd been partners forever." Betty's tone was speculative. "You were laughing when you came back."

"Was I?" I tried to remember. But she was right—I had been laughing. Jamie had made some joke about our handstand photo being worthy of framing, and I'd laughed, genuine and unreserved.

"You were." Betty nudged me. "Maybe Jamie's not as annoying as you thought?"

"He's still annoying."

"But?"

I thought about the afternoon. The way he'd asked Miss Hayes for a sock instead of stealing one. The way he'd climbed the tree to help me find the right pine cone. The way he'd said "Good job, partner" like he meant it, like we'd accomplished something that mattered.

"But maybe he's not entirely terrible," I conceded.

Betty's grin suggested she thought this was significant, but I didn't want to examine why. I'd had fun this afternoon. That was all. Two hours when I'd forgotten to be anxious, forgotten to watch Michael from a distance, forgotten to hide behind books or silence. Two hours when I'd just existed in the moment, solving challenges with someone who apparently brought out a competitive side I didn't know I had.

It didn't mean anything.

Except that night, lying in my bunk while the others whispered and giggled around me, I realized I was still thinking about it. About Jamie's hand in mine for that brief high-five. About the way he'd looked impressed when I solved the riddles. About how we'd run to the checkpoints side by side, both of us equally invested in winning.

About how I'd looked for him at dinner without meaning to, and how when our eyes met across the mess hall, he'd raised his water glass in a small toast to our victory.

I pulled The Secret Garden from my shelf but didn't open it. Instead, I stared at the cabin ceiling and tried to understand why one afternoon with Jamie Sullivan had felt more real than a week of watching Michael Grant from a careful distance.

The answer scared me, so I pushed it away and focused on Mary Lennox's garden until sleep finally came.
