# Chapter 3: The Troublemaker's Introduction

I found my refuge on the second morning.

After breakfast—rubbery scrambled eggs and toast that might have been made yesterday—I'd slipped away from the crowd of girls heading to the activity fair. Betty had tried to convince me to come along, to look at the different options together, but I'd claimed a headache. It wasn't exactly a lie. The noise of the mess hall, the constant chatter in the cabin, the overwhelming presence of so many people all the time—it was giving me an actual headache.

I needed space. Quiet. A place where I could breathe.

The dock had seemed like the obvious choice, but when I'd arrived, three counselors were already there setting up swimming equipment for the day's lessons. So I'd walked farther along the shoreline, following the curve of the lake until the main camp buildings disappeared behind the trees and the noise faded to something manageable.

That's when I found it—the perfect spot. The dock stretched into the water, empty and peaceful in the mid-morning sun. Trees provided some shade on one end, and the water lapped gently against the wooden posts. I could see anyone approaching from the main camp path, which meant no one could sneak up on me.

I settled into the spot that would give me the best view of both the water and the approach, pulled Jane Eyre from the pocket of my shorts, and finally felt my shoulders relax. The book fell open to the page I'd marked with a dried leaf last night. Jane was returning to Mr. Rochester, walking through the grounds of Thornfield to discover what remained after the fire.

The morning sun wasn't too hot yet, filtered as it was through the pine branches. The water reflected blue sky and white clouds. A dragonfly hovered near one of the posts, its wings catching light. For the first time since arriving at Camp Silver Lake, I felt something close to peace.

I lost myself in Jane's journey, in her decision to return despite everything, in Rochester's desperate hope when he heard her voice. The story wrapped around me like a shield against the real world. Ten minutes passed, maybe fifteen. Long enough that I stopped tensing at every distant sound. Long enough that I forgot to be on guard.

The explosion of water came without warning.

One second I was reading about Jane and Rochester's reunion. The next, I was drenched from head to toe, lake water streaming down my face and soaking through my blouse. My book—my precious, borrowed-from-the-library-at-home book—was clutched in my hands, pages clinging together, water dripping from the cover.

I gasped, more from shock than anything else, and looked up just in time to see someone surface from the lake. He shook water from his dark hair like a dog, sending more droplets flying, and when he saw me sitting there soaked and horrified, he grinned. Actually grinned, like soaking someone and ruining their book was the most amusing thing he'd done all day.

"Morning!" he called out cheerfully, treading water about ten feet from the dock.

I couldn't speak. I was staring at Jane Eyre, watching water seep through pages I'd read a dozen times, seeing the ink start to blur on the edges. This wasn't even my book—it belonged to the Oakville Public Library, and it was due back in September, and now it was ruined because some idiot had decided to cannonball right next to the dock without checking if anyone was sitting there.

The boy hauled himself out of the water in one smooth motion, muscles in his arms flexing as he pulled himself onto the dock. Water streamed from his white t-shirt and rolled-up blue jeans. He was maybe seventeen, lean and athletic in the unconscious way of someone who didn't think about it. Dark hair, eyes that might have been green or brown—I couldn't tell through the water still clinging to my eyelashes—and an expression that suggested he found most things in life amusing.

He walked toward me, barefoot on the wet dock, and I scrambled to press water from the book's pages. Maybe if I could just—if I could separate them carefully and let them dry—maybe it wouldn't be completely ruined.

"Oops." He didn't sound remotely apologetic. "Did I get you wet?"

I looked up at him, this stranger who'd destroyed my morning and my book, and found my voice. "You ruined it." The words came out thick with tears I refused to let fall. "You ruined it."

He crouched down beside me, bringing him to eye level, and reached for the book. "Let me see—"

"Don't touch it!" I pulled Jane Eyre protectively to my chest, which only succeeded in getting my blouse wetter. "You've done enough."

But he was faster than I expected. He plucked the book from my hands before I could stop him, holding it up to examine the damage. Water dripped from the pages onto the already-wet dock.

"Jane Eyre," he read from the cover, then looked at me with surprise that seemed genuine. "Huh. Wouldn't have pegged you for the brooding type."

"Give it back." I stood, which put me at a disadvantage since he stood too and he was nearly a head taller. I reached for the book, but he held it just out of reach, not meanly but like this was all some kind of game. "That's mine. Give it back right now."

"Relax." He turned the book over in his hands, still examining it like it was some curious artifact. "It's just water. It'll dry."

"It's from the library," I said, hating how my voice shook. "It's not mine, and now it's ruined, and you—you just—" I couldn't finish the sentence. The anger and humiliation and overwhelming frustration of the past two days came crashing together, and I felt dangerously close to crying in front of this smirking stranger.

Something in my expression must have registered because his grin softened slightly. He wrung water from the book's pages in a way that probably didn't help but seemed like an attempt, then held it out to me.

"Sorry about your book." He said it simply, and for a second, I almost believed him. "I didn't see you sitting there."

I snatched the book back, cradling it against my chest despite the water still dripping from it. "Maybe look before you cannonball off a dock."

"Maybe don't sit right at the edge of a swimming area." His grin was back, full force. "What are you doing out here anyway? Activity fair's happening. Everyone's supposed to be signing up for stuff."

"I don't want to sign up for stuff."

"So you came out here to read?" He said it like that was the strangest concept he'd ever heard. "On a beautiful morning at summer camp, you're hiding with a book?"

"I'm not hiding." The words came out too defensive.

His expression said he didn't believe me for a second. "Sure. What's your name, Not-Hiding Girl?"

I didn't want to tell him. Giving him my name felt like giving him something he could use against me later. But refusing to answer seemed childish, and I was already embarrassed enough.

"Lily Palmer."

"Jamie Sullivan." He stuck out his hand for a handshake, like we were being introduced at some formal event instead of standing on a dock where he'd just soaked me and ruined my book. When I didn't take his hand, he shrugged and ran it through his wet hair instead. "Nice to meet you, Lily Palmer. Sorry about Jane Eyre. She's pretty depressing anyway—you might be better off without her."

"Jane Eyre is not depressing." I couldn't believe I was defending a book to someone who'd just destroyed it. "It's about independence and integrity and finding someone who sees you as an equal."

"Sounds depressing." But he was smiling when he said it, like he was trying to get a reaction from me. "You always this serious about books?"

"You always this destructive about everything?"

The question seemed to delight him. "Usually. Hey, you should try swimming instead of drowning in Victorian literature. Water's great this morning."

"I think you got me wet enough already."

"Fair point." He glanced back toward the main camp area where voices carried through the trees. Someone was calling his name. "That's my cue. Sparky gets impatient when I make him wait. See you around, Lily Palmer."

He walked to the end of the dock, turned back to shoot me one more grin that said he knew exactly how annoyed I was and found it entertaining, then dove cleanly back into the water. He surfaced a few yards out, shook water from his hair again, and swam toward the shore with strong, easy strokes.

I stood alone on the wet dock, holding my ruined book, water still dripping from my hair and clothes. My hands were shaking—from anger or something else, I couldn't quite tell.

Jamie Sullivan. The name would probably haunt me all summer. He was exactly the kind of boy I avoided at school—loud, confident, the type who went through life assuming everyone would find him charming. The type who didn't think about consequences or other people's feelings because everything was just a game to him.

And he'd found my spot. My secret, perfect, quiet refuge was now associated with the memory of being soaked and embarrassed and treated like my feelings were amusing.

I looked down at Jane Eyre. The cover was warped, pages stuck together. I'd have to peel them apart carefully, let them dry, hope the words were still legible. Mrs. Morrison would see it when I returned it, would know I hadn't taken care of it, would think I was careless. That thought made me angrier than almost anything else—someone thinking I didn't respect books.

A boy appeared at the other end of the dock—shorter than Jamie, with curly red hair and an eager expression. "Jamie! Did you do it? Did you actually—" He stopped when he saw me, dripping wet and clearly furious. "Oh. Uh. Hi?"

"Your friend," I said through gritted teeth, "is an idiot."

The boy—Sparky, Jamie had called him—looked torn between apologizing and laughing. "Yeah, he gets that a lot. Sorry about... whatever he did."

He hurried off toward where Jamie was climbing out of the water on the far shore, and I heard their laughter carry across the distance. Laughing about me, probably. About the wet, angry girl with her ruined book.

I gathered what remained of my dignity, clutched Jane Eyre carefully so I wouldn't damage it further, and headed back toward the main camp. My peaceful spot was ruined now, contaminated by the memory of Jamie Sullivan's grin and the feeling of cold lake water soaking through my clothes.

When I reached Cabin 7, thankfully empty since everyone was still at the activity fair, I changed into dry clothes and laid Jane Eyre carefully on my bunk to dry. The pages were starting to separate slightly, but they were still stuck together in places. I'd deal with it later. Right now, I just wanted to forget the entire morning.

Betty returned an hour later, full of enthusiasm about all the activities she'd signed up for. Swimming lessons with Michael Grant. Arts and crafts. Canoeing. The weekly camp newsletter committee. She chattered about all of it while I sat on my bunk, pretending to read a different book—Pride and Prejudice, safely dry—and nodding at appropriate intervals.

"Oh, and I heard Jamie Sullivan's back this summer," Betty said, hanging up the new camp t-shirt she'd bought at the fair. "He's famous for pranks. Got himself sent home early last summer for putting a frog in Mrs. Morrison's desk drawer." She giggled. "He's cute though, in a troublemaker kind of way."

I thought about Jamie's grin, the way he'd held my book out of reach like it was all just fun, the way he'd called me "Not-Hiding Girl" like he could see right through me.

"He's awful," I said flatly.

Betty looked surprised. "Did you meet him already?"

"Unfortunately."

I didn't elaborate, and Betty, bless her, didn't push. She moved on to describing someone's new swimsuit and speculating about whether the boys' camp would visit this year for the traditional joint dance.

I half-listened, still thinking about the dock. About finding a new hiding spot, since that one was clearly compromised. About avoiding Jamie Sullivan for the rest of the summer, which shouldn't be hard if I stayed vigilant.

But that night, lying in my bunk while the other girls whispered and giggled in the darkness, I kept seeing his expression when he'd read the title of my book. The surprise, like I'd revealed something unexpected about myself. The way he'd said "Jane Eyre" like the words meant something.

And I kept hearing his parting words: "See you around, Lily Palmer."

It had sounded like a promise.

Or a threat.

I pulled my blanket up higher and tried to focus on the sound of the lake through the screen windows. Eight weeks suddenly felt very long when I'd have to spend them avoiding someone who seemed determined not to be avoided.
