# Chapter 4: Swimming in Dangerous Waters

The activity sign-up board appeared on the mess hall porch after breakfast, and girls swarmed it like bees around honey. I hung back, waiting for the crowd to thin, but Betty grabbed my arm and pulled me forward.

"Come on! All the good time slots will be gone if we wait."

"Good time slots" apparently meant activities that didn't conflict with rest period or interfered with cabin time. To me, all the time slots looked equally unappealing, but I let Betty drag me to the board anyway.

The sheet was organized by counselor and activity type. I scanned the list: Arts and Crafts with Miss Hayes, Canoeing with Mr. Davidson, Nature Walks with Miss Patterson, Archery with Mr. Williams, Volleyball with Miss Cooper, Swimming and Waterfront Activities with Michael Grant.

My eyes stuck on that last line.

"I'm doing arts and crafts on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons," Betty said, tracing the schedule with her finger. "And I want to try canoeing. What about you?"

I forced my eyes away from Michael's name to look at the other options. They all required being around people, being watched, being evaluated. But if I had to do activities anyway—and Mrs. Morrison had made it clear attendance at daily activities was mandatory—then I might as well choose ones where I could see Michael.

The thought made my cheeks warm, but no one was paying attention to me.

"Swimming," I said quietly. "The morning beginner session."

Betty looked surprised. "I thought you said you didn't like swimming?"

"I said I wasn't very good at it. That's why I'm signing up for the beginner session. To improve." The lie came easily, practiced from years of hiding my real thoughts.

"Okay, I'll sign up for that too!" Betty wrote both our names on the Monday-Wednesday-Friday morning slot. "What else?"

I studied the board. Michael also supervised afternoon canoe safety and general waterfront activities. I added my name to those lists too, along with arts and crafts—which would put me near where I'd seen Michael and Miss Hayes having lunch yesterday.

By the time we walked away, I'd committed to being at the waterfront or near it for most of my available activity time. Betty chattered about how nice it would be to spend mornings together, and I nodded while my stomach twisted with anxiety.

What was I doing? I wasn't a strong swimmer. I didn't like being the center of attention. The cold water made my teeth chatter. But the thought of spending three mornings a week in the same area as Michael Grant made all of that seem bearable.

~~~

The lake looked less appealing at eight-thirty in the morning than it had yesterday evening. Grey clouds filtered the sunlight, and a breeze rippled the water's surface, making it look cold and uninviting. I stood with a group of about fifteen other girls on the dock, most of them younger than me, all of us wearing the modest swimming costumes that camp regulations required—one-piece suits that covered everything and somehow still managed to make me feel exposed.

Michael appeared at exactly eight-thirty, looking somehow even better in swimming trunks and a white t-shirt than he had in his counselor uniform. He carried a clipboard and wore a whistle around his neck, and when he smiled at our group, I felt my heart do that stupid flutter again.

"Good morning, everyone! Thanks for signing up for beginner swimming. I'm Michael Grant, and I'll be your instructor for the next eight weeks." His voice carried across the water without shouting, confident and friendly. "We're going to focus on basic strokes, water safety, and building confidence in the lake. By the end of summer, you'll all be comfortable swimming in the designated area. Sound good?"

A chorus of enthusiastic agreement rose from the group. I nodded silently, already hyperaware of how cold I was going to be in about two minutes.

"Let's start with some basic assessment so I know where everyone's at. I'm going to have you swim from here to the rope and back—that's about twenty feet each way. Use whatever stroke feels comfortable. This isn't a test, just information for me. Who wants to go first?"

Several hands shot up. Michael picked a confident-looking girl who dove in and made the swim look easy. Others followed, some graceful, some splashing and clumsy but getting the job done. Betty went and did a respectable breaststroke, emerging with a huge grin.

The group thinned as each girl took her turn. I kept edging toward the back, hoping to be last, hoping maybe Michael would get distracted and forget about me.

No such luck.

"You're up," he said, looking right at me with that friendly smile. "What's your name?"

"Lily Palmer." My voice came out smaller than I intended.

"Great, Lily. Just swim out to the rope and back, whatever stroke you want. Take your time."

The water looked very cold and very deep. I sat on the edge of the dock, legs dangling, and tried to convince myself to just get it over with. But the longer I sat, the harder it became, and I could feel everyone watching me, waiting.

"The first jump is always the hardest," Michael said, crouching beside me on the dock. "Once you're in, it's not so bad."

He was being kind, encouraging, exactly the way a good instructor should be. But his attention made everything worse because I wanted to impress him and instead I was frozen with anxiety on the dock's edge like a scared child.

I closed my eyes and pushed off.

The water shocked through me—so much colder than I'd expected that I gasped and immediately swallowed lake water. I surfaced, coughing, my eyes stinging. This was already a disaster and I hadn't even started swimming yet.

"You okay?" Michael called.

I nodded, not trusting my voice, and started a messy freestyle toward the rope. My strokes were uneven, my breathing ragged. I reached the rope more through determination than skill, grabbed it for a second to catch my breath, then turned back. The return trip was worse. My arms felt heavy, my lungs burned, and I was hyperaware of everyone watching my complete lack of grace in the water.

I reached the dock and grabbed the ladder, hauling myself out with shaking arms. Water streamed from my swimming costume and hair. I was breathing hard, probably looked like a drowned rat, and wanted nothing more than to disappear.

"Nice job, Lily," Michael said, checking something on his clipboard. "I can see some areas we'll work on, but you made it both ways. That's what counts."

I nodded, wrapping my arms around myself against the cold breeze, and retreated to the back of the group. Betty gave me a thumbs up, but I couldn't meet her eyes.

Michael gathered us back together and started explaining proper freestyle form—arm position, breathing rhythm, kick technique. I tried to focus on his words instead of my embarrassment, tried to memorize everything he said so I could improve, be better, maybe eventually not be the worst swimmer in the beginner group.

"Alright," Michael said after his demonstration, "everyone back in the water. We're going to practice—"

"Sorry I'm late!"

The voice carried across the water, and I looked up to see Jamie Sullivan jogging down the dock, barefoot and grinning like he had every right to interrupt. He wore swimming trunks and a t-shirt that said "Camp Silver Lake" from what must have been a previous summer, and he looked completely unrepentant about being fifteen minutes late.

Michael's friendly expression shifted to something more stern. "Jamie. We started at eight-thirty."

"Yeah, I overslept. Sparky forgot to wake me up. Won't happen again." The apology sounded practiced and insincere.

"This is beginner swimming," Michael said. "You tested advanced last year."

"I know, but I thought I'd help out. You know, assistant counselor type stuff." Jamie's grin widened. "Plus, I wanted to brush up on my freestyle form."

Something in Michael's expression said he didn't believe a word of this but also didn't have time to argue. "Fine. Get in the water with everyone else. And Jamie? If you're late again, you're out of the class."

"Got it, boss."

Jamie walked to the end of the dock and dove in cleanly, barely making a splash. He surfaced and shook water from his hair in that gesture I was starting to recognize, then swam a lazy backstroke toward the group.

I focused very hard on looking anywhere but at him.

Michael resumed his instruction, having us practice freestyle arms while holding onto the dock. I positioned myself at the far end, as far from Jamie as possible, and tried to concentrate on what Michael was demonstrating. But I was aware—painfully aware—of Jamie's presence in the water, of the way he made jokes that got the younger girls giggling, of how he seemed completely at ease where I felt awkward and exposed.

During free swim time at the end of the lesson, most girls splashed around near the dock. I stayed in the shallow area, practicing the arm motion Michael had shown us, determined to improve before the next lesson.

A large splash next to me sent water directly into my face.

I sputtered and wiped my eyes to find Jamie treading water about three feet away, that infuriating grin on his face.

"You following me, Palmer?" He'd apparently decided we were on last-name basis. "First the dock, now beginner swimming?"

"You're the one who showed up late to my swimming lesson," I shot back, pleased that my voice came out steady despite my shivering.

"Your swimming lesson?" He swam closer, and I backed up instinctively. "Pretty sure Michael runs these for everyone. How's the book, by the way? Did it survive?"

"It's drying."

"You should be thanking me, really. Now you have an excuse to read something less depressing." He dove under the water and surfaced behind a group of younger girls, who shrieked and splashed him. He laughed and splashed back, and suddenly the whole free swim period devolved into chaos.

Michael blew his whistle. "Alright, that's enough! Good work this morning, everyone. Same time Wednesday. Jamie, can I talk to you for a second?"

I climbed out quickly, grabbed my towel, and headed back toward the cabins before Jamie could intercept me again. Betty caught up, chattering about how much fun that was and how nice Michael was as an instructor. I made appropriate agreeing sounds while trying to ignore the fact that my arms ached, my eyes stung from lake water, and I'd made a complete fool of myself in front of Michael.

At least I had the afternoon arts and crafts session to look forward to. That would be calm, quiet, and most importantly, Jamie-free.

~~~

I was wrong about the Jamie-free part.

Arts and crafts took place in an open-sided building near the mess hall, with long tables for working and shelves stocked with supplies. Miss Hayes—Dorothy, she insisted we call her—was demonstrating how to make lanyards, the plastic strings bright and cheerful against the wooden table.

I'd volunteered to help distribute supplies, which gave me a legitimate reason to move around the room and positioned me near the porch where I'd seen Michael and Dorothy eating lunch yesterday. Sure enough, around noon, Michael appeared with two paper-wrapped sandwiches and handed one to Dorothy.

They sat on the porch steps, close enough that I could hear their conversation if I focused while pretending to organize plastic string.

"How was morning swimming?" Dorothy asked.

"Good group. A few kids really nervous about the water, but they'll warm up." Michael took a bite of his sandwich. "Jamie Sullivan showed up late and tried to convince me he wanted to help instruct."

Dorothy laughed. "Jamie's back? Mrs. Morrison must be thrilled."

"He lasted three days last summer before the frog incident."

"It was a very large frog."

They both laughed, the easy laughter of people who knew each other well, and I felt something twist in my chest. They looked comfortable together. Natural. Like they'd had this exact lunch conversation a hundred times before.

I was so focused on watching them that I didn't notice someone sliding onto the bench at my work table until he spoke.

"You're not very subtle."

I jumped and spun to find Jamie Sullivan grinning at me, a pile of plastic lanyard string in front of him like he actually planned to make something.

"What are you doing here?" I whispered harshly. "This is arts and crafts. I signed up for this."

"So did I. Just now. Dorothy said I could join." He picked up two strings—blue and red—and started the beginning of a lanyard with surprising competence. "You seemed distracted. Thought I'd see what was so interesting."

My face burned. "I'm not distracted. I'm organizing supplies."

"Sure." His eyes flicked toward where Michael and Dorothy sat, then back to me. "That's definitely what's happening."

"Don't you have somewhere else to be? Archery or something?"

"Archery got boring." He focused on his lanyard, fingers nimble with the plastic strings. "Plus, I figured I owed you. For the book thing. Thought I'd apologize properly."

I didn't know what to say to that. An apology was the last thing I'd expected from Jamie Sullivan.

"It's fine," I managed. "The book is drying."

"You said that already at swimming." He glanced up, and for a second, his expression was something other than amused. Almost serious. "I really didn't see you on the dock. I wouldn't have jumped if I'd known someone was there."

"Okay."

"Okay." He went back to his lanyard, the moment passing. "So what are you making?"

"I'm not making anything. I'm helping Dorothy distribute supplies."

"You should make something. That's kind of the point of arts and crafts." He held up his growing lanyard. "See? I'm being very crafty."

Despite myself, I felt the corner of my mouth twitch. The lanyard actually looked good—even stitches, nice color pattern. "Where'd you learn to do that?"

"Juvenile detention." When my eyes went wide, he laughed. "Kidding. Summer camp three years ago. You never forget how to make a lanyard. It's like riding a bike, except more useless."

A clatter of boxes made us both look up. I'd been so distracted by Jamie that I'd backed into the supply shelf, and now beads were rolling everywhere across the wooden floor.

"Smooth," Jamie said, but he was already on his knees helping me pick them up.

"This is your fault," I muttered, chasing a blue bead under the table. "You distracted me."

"I'm very distracting. It's one of my best qualities."

We gathered beads in awkward silence, both reaching for the same green one at the same time. Our hands touched briefly, and I pulled back like I'd been burned.

"Got it," Jamie said, dropping the bead into the box I was holding. His eyes held that knowing look again, like he could see more than I wanted him to. "You should probably get back to your organizing. Looks like very important work."

He returned to his seat and his lanyard, leaving me to finish collecting beads with shaking hands. When I finally stood and carried the box back to the supply area, Dorothy was alone on the porch—Michael had gone back to the waterfront.

I'd missed whatever else they'd talked about because Jamie Sullivan had decided to show up and insert himself into my afternoon.

That night, lying in my bunk while the other girls whispered and giggled around me, I replayed the day. Michael asking my name. The cold water. My terrible swimming. Jamie's apology. The way he'd looked at me when we reached for the same bead, like he was trying to figure out a puzzle.

I'd signed up for activities to be near Michael, to maybe catch his attention, to feed the safe fantasy I was building. But somehow, Jamie kept appearing in every space I occupied, disrupting my plans with his grin and his questions and his unsettling ability to see things I didn't want seen.

Eight weeks suddenly seemed very complicated.
