# Chapter 5: The Cannonball Conspiracy

I learned quickly that arriving early to swimming meant a few precious minutes with Michael before the chaos of class began. So on Friday morning, I left the cabin ten minutes before I needed to, walked the path to the lake at a pace that suggested casual morning stroll rather than desperate eagerness, and arrived at the dock while Michael was still setting out equipment.

"Morning, Lily," he said, looking up from the pile of kickboards he was organizing. "You're early."

My heart did its now-familiar flutter at hearing him say my name. "I thought I'd... I mean, I wanted to... can I help?"

"Sure! Can you set these kickboards along the dock? Space them about three feet apart. We're going to work on kicks today."

He handed me the stack of foam boards, and our fingers brushed briefly in the transfer. I tried not to read anything into it—he was just handing me equipment, not declaring his undying devotion—but my traitorous heart sped up anyway.

I arranged the kickboards carefully, making sure they were perfectly spaced, trying to look competent and helpful. Michael worked nearby, coiling ropes and checking that the swimming area boundary floats were secure. The morning was beautiful—warm sun, light breeze, water sparkling in that way that made you forget how cold it was.

"So," Michael said, breaking the comfortable silence, "how are you settling into camp? It's your first year, right?"

He remembered. He'd paid enough attention during our first class to remember I was new.

"Yes," I managed. "It's... it's nice. Different from what I expected."

"Different how?"

"I guess I thought it would be more..." I searched for the right word that wouldn't make me sound like the antisocial bookworm I was. "Overwhelming. But it's not so bad."

Michael smiled, that easy smile that made him look even more handsome. "Camp can be a lot at first. But once you find your routine, it gets easier. You making friends?"

"My cabin-mate Betty is really nice."

"That's good. Friends make the summer." He checked his watch—a practical silver one that caught the light. "Class starts in five minutes. Thanks for the help with setup, Lily. You're reliable."

Reliable. It wasn't romantic, but it was something. He'd noticed me enough to form an opinion about my character. That had to count for something, right?

Other girls started arriving, Betty among them. She waved and came to stand beside me, whispering, "You're here early. Dedicated to improving that freestyle?"

"Something like that."

The class gathered, Michael started his welcome, and I let myself relax into the routine. This was good. This was working. Three mornings a week, I had a legitimate reason to be near Michael, to hear his voice, to maybe earn more compliments like "reliable." It wasn't much, but it was more than I'd had four days ago.

Then I heard them.

Voices carried across the water—male voices, laughing about something. I turned to see Jamie and Sparky approaching the dock, but they weren't dressed for swimming. They were carrying something. Rope, I realized as they got closer. A lot of rope.

"Morning, Michael!" Jamie called out cheerfully. "Don't mind us. Just doing some... recreational improvements."

Michael's expression shifted from instructor-friendly to wary. "What are you doing with that rope, Jamie?"

"Science project." Jamie's grin was pure mischief. "About gravity and momentum and fun."

He and Sparky walked past our group toward the large oak tree that overhung the deep end of the swimming area. I watched with growing dread as they started tying the rope to a thick branch that extended out over the water.

"Jamie," Michael called, his voice taking on an edge. "Stop what you're doing right now."

"Almost done!" Sparky yelled back.

They worked with the efficiency of people who'd planned this, tying knots and testing the rope's strength. Within two minutes, they'd created a rope swing that hung from the branch, the end dangling about ten feet above the water.

Jamie grabbed the rope, backed up to get a running start, and launched himself into space. He swung out over the water in a perfect arc, let go at the apex, and dropped into the lake with a massive splash that sent waves rippling toward our group. He surfaced, triumphant, and pumped his fist in the air.

"That was amazing!" Sparky shouted. "My turn!"

Several of the younger girls in our class cheered. Betty laughed. Even I had to admit it looked fun—if you were the kind of person who thought risking your neck for a moment of excitement was fun.

Michael blew his whistle, three sharp blasts that cut through the laughter and cheering.

"Everyone out of the water. Now." His voice had gone from friendly instructor to absolute authority. "Class is suspended until further notice."

Jamie swam toward the dock, looking less triumphant now. Sparky had frozen halfway through his approach to the rope swing, suddenly understanding they might be in actual trouble.

"Both of you, get over here," Michael ordered.

I'd never seen him angry before. He'd been patient with struggling swimmers, gentle with nervous campers, friendly with everyone. But now his jaw was tight, and his eyes had a hardness that made me glad I wasn't Jamie or Sparky.

They stood in front of him, dripping lake water, while the rest of us watched from what felt like a safe distance. I should have looked away, given them privacy for what was clearly going to be a lecture, but I couldn't. None of us could.

"Do you know why rope swings aren't allowed at Camp Silver Lake?" Michael asked. His voice was quiet, which somehow made it more effective than yelling. "Or did you not bother to read the safety regulations?"

"We thought—" Jamie started.

"I don't care what you thought. Rope swings are prohibited because someone can hit the tree branch on the way out, or land in shallow water, or come down on another swimmer. I've seen a kid break his arm on a rope swing. I've seen a girl nearly drown because she hit the water wrong and got disoriented. These rules exist for reasons."

Sparky looked genuinely sorry. Jamie's expression was harder to read—something between defiant and ashamed.

"You're going to take that rope down," Michael continued. "Then you're both going to report to Mrs. Morrison and explain what you did. And Jamie, this is strike two. One more incident and you're done at this camp. Understand?"

"Yes, sir," Sparky mumbled.

Jamie just nodded, his jaw set in a way that suggested he wanted to argue but knew better.

"The rest of you, swimming is canceled for this morning," Michael announced to our group. "We'll resume Monday. I apologize for the disruption."

The girls dispersed, some disappointed, others excited to have unexpected free time. Betty tried to catch my eye, but I was already walking away, fury building with each step.

Thirty seconds. I'd had thirty seconds of Michael's positive attention this morning. He'd called me reliable. We'd had an actual conversation. And then Jamie Sullivan had shown up with his stupid rope swing and ruined everything.

My hands clenched into fists as I stalked up the path toward the main camp. The pine trees blurred past, and I was breathing hard—not from exertion but from anger so pure it felt like it might burn through my chest.

"Palmer! Wait up!"

Absolutely not. I walked faster.

"Lily, come on. I know you're mad, but—"

"Leave me alone!" I spun to face him, not caring that my voice came out too loud, too emotional, too revealing. "Just leave me alone!"

Jamie stopped a few feet away, hands raised in a placating gesture. He'd put his t-shirt back on but was still dripping lake water. "Look, I'm sorry swimming got canceled, okay? I didn't think—"

"You never think! That's the problem!" The words erupted from somewhere I didn't know I had volume. "Some of us are trying to follow the rules and have a nice summer, but you have to ruin everything with your pranks and your—your complete disregard for anyone else!"

"It was just a rope swing. We weren't hurting anyone."

"You got class canceled! Michael had to—" I stopped, realizing too late what I'd revealed.

Jamie's expression shifted to something knowing and a little bit mean. "Right. Michael. That's what this is really about, isn't it?"

"I don't know what you're talking about."

"Yes, you do." He stepped closer, and I resisted the urge to step back. "You show up early to swimming to moon over him. You volunteer to set up equipment. You watch him like a puppy waiting for scraps, hoping he'll notice you."

The observation hit like a slap. "That's not—I don't—"

"It's kind of pathetic, actually." His voice wasn't loud, but the words landed hard. "He's twenty years old, Lily. You're sixteen. He's a counselor. You're a camper. Even if he did notice you—which he won't—nothing's going to happen."

"You don't know anything about it." My voice shook, betraying how close I was to crying. "You don't know anything about me."

"I know you're wasting your summer on a fantasy." He shoved his hands in his pockets, looking frustrated now rather than amused. "I know you're too scared to actually talk to him, so you hide behind volunteering and showing up early and pretending you're interested in swimming when really you're just interested in staring at someone who'll never look at you the way you want."

The words were cruel and accurate and I hated him for saying them out loud. For making my secret pathetic crush into something we were discussing on a pine-needled path with morning sun filtering through the trees.

"Why do you even care?" I demanded. "Why do you care what I do or who I look at or how I spend my summer?"

Jamie opened his mouth, closed it, seemed to struggle with something. Finally, he said, "Because it's painful to watch."

"Then stop watching!"

"I can't seem to help it." The admission came out frustrated, like he was as confused by it as I was. "You're everywhere, Palmer. Hiding with your books, pretending to be invisible, wasting your time on someone who sees you as just another camper. And yeah, it bothers me. I don't know why, but it does."

We stood there, breathing hard, glaring at each other. The morning that had started so hopefully—Michael saying my name, calling me reliable, actually talking to me like I mattered—had dissolved into this: standing on a path fighting with a boy I barely knew about feelings I didn't want to examine.

"You're cruel," I said finally. "You think you're funny and charming, but you're just cruel."

Something flickered across his face—hurt, maybe, or recognition. But his voice stayed light, defensive. "And you're hiding. At least I'm honest about being a screw-up. You're lying to yourself about what you want and whether you're brave enough to actually try for it."

"I'm not hiding!"

"You're always hiding." He said it simply, like it was obvious fact. "Behind books, behind that quiet act, behind a crush on someone safe because he'll never actually want you back. You can pine for Michael all summer and never risk being rejected because you're never really putting yourself out there. It's cowardly."

The word hit harder than anything else he'd said. Cowardly. I'd been called quiet, shy, antisocial, boring. But never cowardly.

"I hate you," I whispered.

"Yeah." He looked tired suddenly, the fight draining from his expression. "I'm pretty used to that."

He walked away, back toward the lake where he still had to take down the rope swing and face Mrs. Morrison. I stood alone on the path, shaking with anger and humiliation and the terrible suspicion that some of what he'd said might be true.

When I finally made it back to Cabin 7, it was blessedly empty. I climbed into my bunk, pulled Pride and Prejudice from the shelf, and tried to disappear into Elizabeth Bennet's world where people said cruel things in elegant language and everything worked out in the end.

But I couldn't focus on the words. I kept hearing Jamie's voice: "You're wasting your summer on a fantasy. You watch him like a puppy waiting for scraps. It's cowardly."

Betty found me an hour later, still in my bunk, the book open but unread in my lap.

"There you are! Everyone's talking about Jamie's rope swing. Apparently, Mrs. Morrison gave him kitchen duty for a week. And—" She stopped, seeing my expression. "Are you okay?"

"Fine."

"You don't look fine."

"I just want to be alone."

Betty hesitated, then nodded. "Okay. But if you want to talk about whatever happened..."

"I don't."

She left, and I was grateful for it. I didn't want to talk about Jamie Sullivan or his casual cruelty or the way his words had burrowed under my skin. I didn't want to think about whether he was right, whether I was hiding, whether my crush on Michael was less about Michael and more about safety.

I just wanted to finish this chapter, then the next one, then the next, until the book was done and I could start another. Books didn't call you pathetic. They didn't point out your flaws or make you question your choices. They just existed, reliable and unchanging, exactly what you needed them to be.

That night at dinner, I saw Jamie at a table across the mess hall. He was laughing with Sparky about something, looking completely unbothered by our fight. Meanwhile, I'd spent hours replaying every word, feeling the sting of them over and over.

Michael sat at the counselors' table with Dorothy, both of them smiling about something. He looked happy, confident, completely unaware that somewhere in this mess hall a sixteen-year-old girl was nursing a crush on him. Unaware and, I realized with sinking certainty, uninterested even if he knew.

Jamie was right about that much, at least.

The realization didn't make me hate him any less.
