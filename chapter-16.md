# Chapter 16: The Talent Show Announcement

Mrs. Morrison stood on a chair in the mess hall—actually stood on a chair, which was remarkable enough that conversation died immediately. She had that effect, equal parts grandmother and general, commanding attention through sheer force of presence.

"Campers!" Her voice rang through the space. "I have exciting news. The annual Camp Silver Lake talent show will take place in three weeks, on the twenty-seventh. This is our biggest event of the summer, and I expect everyone to participate—either performing or helping backstage."

The mess hall erupted. Girls bounced in their seats, immediately planning acts with their cabin-mates. Excited chatter about singing, dancing, comedy sketches filled the air. Betty grabbed my arm, her eyes bright.

"We should do a skit! Cabin 7 together! Maybe something funny about camp life?"

"Maybe," I hedged, already planning my escape to backstage work.

Mrs. Morrison continued over the noise. "Sign-up sheets for performers and crew will be posted after breakfast. Rehearsals begin next week. This is your chance to shine, campers. Make it count!"

She stepped down from the chair—gracefully, despite her age and sensible shoes—and conversation exploded again. Plans formed instantly, alliances shifted, the social dynamics of who would perform with whom creating ripples through the room.

I caught myself looking for Jamie before I realized I was doing it. Old habit, even though we'd just reconciled yesterday. He sat at his usual table with Sparky, both of them studying the announcement with interest. As if sensing my gaze, Jamie looked up. Our eyes met across the crowded mess hall, and he gave me a small smile—genuine, no trace of the defensive mask.

I smiled back, something warm settling in my chest.

"Earth to Lily," Betty said, waving a hand in front of my face. "You zoned out completely. What do you think?"

"About the skit?"

"Yes, about the skit! We could write something about the swimming lessons, or the mystery meat, or—"

"I think I'll help backstage," I said. "You know I'm not good with performing."

Betty's expression said she'd expected this, but she tried anyway. "It would be fun though! Safer in a group, right?"

"I'll think about it," I lied.

After breakfast, the crowd around the sign-up board was three deep with girls claiming performance slots and arguing about time allocation. I hung back, waiting for the chaos to thin. I'd sign up for lighting crew or stage management—something useful and invisible.

"Palmer!"

I turned to find Michael approaching, his counselor clipboard in hand and that friendly smile that used to make my heart race. It still made me feel something, but the sensation was different now—pleasant rather than overwhelming, admiration without the desperate need for his attention.

"Hey, Michael."

"I was hoping to catch you. We need someone reliable to handle technical stuff for the talent show—lighting cues, curtain timing, that kind of thing. Dorothy mentioned how organized you were at the waterfront shed, and I thought you'd be perfect. Interested?"

My first instinct was to say yes immediately, to leap at any opportunity to spend time near Michael. But I hesitated, aware of the pattern I'd been following all summer, aware of Jamie's words about chasing fantasy.

Still. This was practical. Useful. Not mooning over him from a distance but actually contributing.

"Sure," I said. "I can do that."

"Excellent!" Michael checked something on his clipboard. "We'll have planning meetings starting tomorrow—me, Dorothy, and you to coordinate everything. Should be fun. Thanks for volunteering, Lily."

He walked away, already moving on to the next task, and I stood there processing. Three weeks of working closely with Michael and Dorothy. Three weeks of watching their easy partnership, of being the helpful assistant. Three weeks of confronting the reality behind my fantasy.

Maybe this would be good. Maybe this was exactly what I needed—to see Michael as he actually was, rather than the idea I'd built in my head.

"That looked like an interesting conversation."

Jamie had appeared beside me, carrying a mug of what smelled like the terrible camp coffee. His expression was carefully neutral, but something in his eyes suggested he'd seen the whole exchange.

"Michael asked me to help with the talent show. Technical stuff—lighting and curtains."

"Of course he did. You're reliable and organized." His tone was dry but not mocking. "Three weeks of quality time with Golden Boy. Should be enlightening."

"Jamie—"

"I'm not judging. Honest." He took a sip of his coffee, made a face. "How they make coffee this bad is actually impressive. It's like they're trying to punish us." He paused, then asked in a more serious tone, "You sure you want to sign up for that? For three weeks of watching him with Dorothy?"

The question wasn't mean—it was genuinely concerned. And that made me consider it actually.

"I need to see it," I said slowly, working out the thought as I spoke. "See him, I mean. Really see him, not the fantasy version. Maybe this will help."

Jamie nodded slowly. "Okay. Just... be careful with yourself, yeah?"

"Yeah." I gestured to the sign-up board. "What about you? Are you performing?"

Something shifted in his expression—a flash of nervousness quickly masked. "Maybe. Haven't decided yet."

"Jamie Sullivan turning down a chance to be the center of attention? Are you feeling okay?"

"Hilarious." But he smiled. "If I did perform, it wouldn't be my usual chaos. I'm thinking about doing something... different."

"Different how?"

He hesitated, then shook his head. "If I do it, you'll see. If I chicken out, we'll pretend this conversation never happened."

"That's mysterious."

"I'm a man of mystery, Palmer. You know this."

Betty appeared at my elbow, tugging me toward the sign-up board. "Come on, the crowd's thinning. Sign up for crew before all the spots are gone!"

I let her pull me away, but I glanced back at Jamie. He was watching me with an expression I couldn't quite read—something that looked like concern mixed with something else. Something softer.

The first planning meeting happened that afternoon in the mess hall, which was empty except for the three of us. Michael had brought a notebook full of ideas and schedules. Dorothy carried her arts and crafts supplies for set design. I arrived with a pencil and the beginning of a headache.

"Thanks for coming, Lily," Michael said, gesturing to the seat beside him. Dorothy sat on his other side, already sketching something on a large pad of paper. "Let's go over the schedule first..."

They fell into easy collaboration, finishing each other's sentences when discussing the stage setup. Dorothy suggested a color scheme for the backdrop. Michael agreed immediately, adding ideas that built on hers. They had the chemistry of people who'd worked together before, who understood each other's creative language.

I took notes methodically, trying to pay attention to the actual content rather than the growing realization that they were perfect together. Not in a painful way—just in an obvious way that I'd been deliberately ignoring all summer.

"What do you think, Lily?" Michael asked, and I realized I'd zoned out completely.

"Sorry, what?"

"About the lighting. Should we do spotlights for solo performances or keep it general stage wash?"

I thought about it actually, applying myself to the practical problem rather than the emotional one. "Spotlights for solos would be more dramatic. But we'd need someone practicing the cues so the timing's right."

"That's great thinking," Dorothy said warmly. "You could run through it with performers during rehearsals, get the timing down."

"Yeah, I can do that."

They moved on to other topics—performer sign-ups, rehearsal schedules, whether Sparky's magic act was going to be a disaster or just embarrassing. I contributed when asked, but mostly I watched.

Michael's kindness was real, but it was universal. The way he listened to Dorothy's set ideas with genuine interest, the way he laughed at her jokes, the way they shared glances full of private meaning—that was specific. That was what actually caring about someone looked like.

And it wasn't how he looked at me. It never had been.

The realization didn't hurt the way I'd expected. It just felt true, like accepting something I'd always known but had been too invested in the fantasy to acknowledge.

After an hour, Dorothy had to leave for another commitment. She squeezed Michael's shoulder as she passed, a casual intimacy that spoke of comfort and history. Michael's hand covered hers briefly—an automatic gesture that confirmed everything.

"She's great," I said after she'd gone, testing the words.

"The best," Michael agreed easily. "I'm lucky she agreed to help with this on top of all her arts and crafts responsibilities." He checked his watch. "I should head to waterfront. Thanks for your input today, Lily. You're going to make this run so much smoother."

After he left, I sat alone in the empty mess hall, my notes in front of me, thinking about the difference between fantasy and reality.

Fantasy Michael was perfect, attainable if I was just good enough, waiting to notice me. Reality Michael was kind but distant, already completely engaged with someone else, treating me like a competent assistant rather than a potential romantic interest.

And strangely, reality felt easier to handle than the fantasy I'd been maintaining.

That evening at dinner, Jamie slid into the seat across from me, earning a raised eyebrow from Betty.

"How'd the planning meeting go?" he asked, stealing a roll from the bread basket.

"Fine. We have a schedule. I'll be handling lights."

"And?"

"And nothing. It was a meeting. We discussed logistics." I paused, then added honestly, "And I watched him with Dorothy and realized you were right. About all of it."

Jamie looked surprised, then something like relief crossed his face. "Yeah?"

"Yeah. He treats me like a useful volunteer. He treats her like someone who matters." I pushed my mystery meat around my plate. "I don't actually know him, Jamie. I know his smile and his swimming stories and the way he's patient with nervous campers. But I don't know what makes him laugh or what scares him or what he wants beyond the surface. And he doesn't know any of that about me either."

"That must be rough to realize."

"It's actually kind of... freeing?" I looked up at him. "The fantasy was work. Constant hoping and planning and trying to be noticed. Reality is simpler—he's a nice guy dating someone else, and I'm a camper helping with a show. No emotional investment required."

Jamie smiled, small and genuine. "That's growth, Palmer."

"Don't sound so proud. You'll ruin your troublemaker reputation."

"Too late. Sparky already told me I've gone soft." But he didn't sound bothered by it. "So what now?"

"Now I help with the talent show, practice my lighting cues, and stop trying to make Michael into something he isn't."

"And meanwhile?" Jamie asked, his tone carefully casual, "do you have any interest in seeing what's actually happening around you? The real stuff you've been missing?"

The question hung in the air between us, loaded with meaning. I thought about the way my heart had jumped when I'd found Jamie at our reading spot yesterday. About looking for him first in the mess hall this morning. About how his concern felt different from Michael's kindness—specific rather than general, personal rather than professional.

"Maybe," I said carefully. "I'm working on it."

Jamie's smile widened. "That's all I'm asking."

Over the next few days, I noticed Jamie's name on the talent show sign-up sheet—listed as a solo performance, no other details. When I asked him about it, he just said he was still working on something and changed the subject.

Sparky reported that Jamie had been spending hours at the arts and crafts building, working on some project Dorothy was helping him with. Betty mentioned she'd seen him practicing something by the reading spot after dinner, but he'd stopped when he noticed her watching.

The mystery of Jamie's talent show act became camp gossip, speculation running wild about what the camp troublemaker could be planning that required so much serious effort.

I wondered too, but I didn't push. He'd tell me when he was ready. Or he'd show me at the performance. Either way, I found myself looking forward to it—to seeing this thing that Jamie was putting real work into, whatever it was.

Three weeks suddenly felt both too long and not long enough. Too long to wait to see Jamie's mysterious performance. Not long enough to figure out what was happening between us, what the shift in my feelings meant, whether the way my heart raced when he smiled at me was friendship or something more complicated.

But for the first time all summer, I wasn't hiding from the uncertainty. I was just... living in it. Letting it unfold. Seeing what happened when I stopped controlling everything and let real life happen.

It was terrifying and exciting in equal measure.

And somewhere, I thought Jamie might understand exactly how that felt.
