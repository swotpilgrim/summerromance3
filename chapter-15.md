# Chapter 15: The Book Apology

The package appeared on my bunk after lunch, wrapped in brown paper and tied with string like something from another era. My name was written on top in handwriting I recognized immediately, even though I'd only seen it once before—on the note tucked inside The Catcher in the Rye.

My hands trembled as I picked it up. The other girls were outside at activities, the cabin empty and quiet in the afternoon heat. I sat on my bunk, holding the package like it might disappear if I wasn't careful.

Inside the wrapping was a book. Worn but well-loved, the cover soft from being read multiple times. *To Kill a Mockingbird.* A note was tucked inside the front cover, folded carefully.

I unfolded it with shaking hands.

*I'm sorry. I was a jerk about how I said it, even if I wasn't wrong about what I said. You don't have to forgive me, but I miss talking to you. -J*

I read it three times, four times, memorizing every word. The apology was there, simple and direct. But so was the qualifier—*even if I wasn't wrong about what I said*. He wasn't taking back his truths, just apologizing for the delivery.

And he missed talking to me.

I held the book against my chest, feeling something crack open in the hollow place the past four days had created. He'd reached out first. After everything I'd said, after the cruel weapon I'd made of his vulnerability, he'd still reached out.

I sat there for a long time, thinking. About the fight, about my vicious words, about four days of mutual misery. About whether sorry could fix what I'd broken.

Finally, I made a decision.

I slipped the note back into the book, climbed down from my bunk, and headed for our spot by the rocks. If Jamie was going to be anywhere, if he was willing to try to fix this, he'd be there.

The walk felt longer than usual, my heart hammering with each step. What if he wasn't there? What if he'd left the book and moved on, done trying? What if I'd destroyed this completely and the apology was just him being kind, giving closure rather than opening a door?

But when I rounded the bend and the rocks came into view, he was there.

Jamie stood at the water's edge, skipping stones across the lake. His posture was different from the confident, almost cocky way he usually held himself—shoulders slightly hunched, movements mechanical rather than fluid. He looked smaller somehow. Tired.

He heard my footsteps and turned. When he saw me, his expression shifted through surprise to something carefully guarded. The defensive mask wasn't quite in place, but I could see him reaching for it.

"Palmer." His voice was neutral, giving nothing away.

"Sullivan." I clutched the book tighter. "Thank you for the book."

"You're welcome." He picked up another stone, examined it, threw it. It skipped four times before sinking. "You didn't have to come find me. The note said you don't have to forgive me."

"I know." I moved closer but kept distance between us, uncertain of my welcome. "Can I ask you something?"

"Sure."

"Do you really think I'm hiding?"

He was quiet for a long moment, the only sound the gentle lap of water and the distant calls of campers at the main camp. Finally, he turned to face me fully.

"Yeah," he said. "But I get it, because I do the same thing. Just differently."

"Your pranks."

"My pranks. My whole troublemaker act. It's all performance—a way to control how people see me before they can reject the real version." He picked up another stone but didn't throw it, just turned it over in his hands. "We're both hiding. You disappear, I make noise. Same fear, opposite methods."

I sat down on our rock, the one where we'd shared comfortable silences and tentative friendship. After a moment, Jamie sat too, but at the other end, maintaining the space between us.

"I need to apologize," I said. "Really apologize, not just thank you for a book. What I said about your parents—" My voice cracked. "That was cruel. You trusted me with something painful, and I used it to hurt you because I was angry. That was wrong. I'm so sorry, Jamie."

His jaw tightened, but he nodded. "It hurt."

"I know. And I can't take it back, but I am sorry. You didn't deserve that."

"You didn't deserve me calling you cowardly." He was still turning the stone over in his hands, not looking at me. "That was harsh. But Lily, I stand by the rest of it. You are hiding behind the Michael crush because it's safe. And I get why—being seen is terrifying. But watching you waste your summer hoping for something that won't happen when there's—" He stopped abruptly.

"When there's what?"

"When there's other stuff happening that you're missing." He finally looked at me, and something in his expression made my breath catch. "You keep watching him when you could be... doing other things. Being present for real life instead of a fantasy."

The air between us felt charged, full of things we weren't saying. I thought about Betty's comments, about Jamie looking at me when he thought no one was watching. About the way my heart had hammered when I'd seen him standing by the lake just now.

"Why did you chase Michael's attention so hard?" he asked quietly. "Honest answer."

I thought about it, really thought about it instead of deflecting. "Because if he never noticed me, he couldn't reject me. As long as it was this distant crush, I was safe. I could have the feelings without the risk."

"And now?"

"Now I think you were right. I was in love with an idea, not a person. I don't actually know Michael at all." The admission felt like freedom and failure at the same time. "But admitting you're right doesn't mean it didn't hurt when you said it."

"I know. And I'm sorry for that—for how I said it, even if it needed to be said." He finally threw the stone he'd been holding. It skipped six times. "I was watching you set yourself up for heartbreak, and I couldn't just stand by and let it happen."

"Why do you care so much?" The question I'd asked before, but this time I really wanted the answer.

Jamie was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was soft, almost hesitant. "Because watching you chase someone who didn't see you was painful when I..." He trailed off, shook his head. "When I could see you. Every book you loved, every expression you made, every time you tried to disappear and I couldn't stop noticing you anyway. I've been seeing you since day one, Lily. And watching you pour all that hope into someone who'd never look back—it sucked."

My heart was doing complicated things in my chest. "Jamie—"

"I'm not saying this to pressure you or make this weird," he said quickly. "I'm just being honest. You asked why I cared, and that's why. Because I couldn't not notice you, even when you were trying so hard to be invisible."

We sat in silence, the weight of his words settling between us. The August afternoon was perfect—sun warm on our skin, breeze off the lake carrying the scent of water and pine, the distant sounds of camp life continuing without us.

"I missed you," I said finally. "These past four days. I missed talking to you."

"I missed you too." His voice was rough. "Sparky's great, but he doesn't have opinions about books or get my references or..." He gestured vaguely at the space between us. "This. Whatever this is."

"Friendship?" I suggested, though the word felt insufficient for whatever was happening.

"Yeah. Friendship." But something in his tone suggested he was thinking what I was thinking—that maybe it was becoming something more complicated than that.

"Are we okay?" I asked. "Really okay?"

Jamie considered this. "I think we're better than okay. We fought, said terrible things, and we're still here trying to fix it. That's more real than most friendships."

"Real means you can hurt each other but choose to repair it," I said, remembering our conversation from weeks ago.

"Exactly." He smiled, small but genuine. "So yeah, Palmer. We're okay. We're friends who fight and make up, and that means something."

The relief that flooded through me was almost overwhelming. I'd been carrying the weight of the fight for four days, the certainty that I'd destroyed something irreparable. But here we were, working through it, choosing each other despite the damage.

"Thank you for the book," I said again, holding up *To Kill a Mockingbird*. "How did you know I wanted to read it?"

"You mentioned it once, like two weeks ago. Said you'd read it in school but wanted to read it again as something other than homework." He shrugged. "I pay attention."

"You really do." The observation settled something in my chest. Jamie noticed things—what books I wanted, what dessert I preferred, when I was upset before I said anything. He paid attention in a way Michael never had, never would.

The realization didn't hurt like I'd expected it to. It just felt true.

We sat together as the afternoon stretched toward evening, not quite back to the easy comfort we'd had before the fight but getting there. We talked about small things—the talent show announcement that had happened while we weren't speaking, Sparky's latest prank idea, the book Jamie was reading.

"Are you still coming to the reading spot?" he asked eventually. "Our spot, I mean. I haven't seen you here since..."

"Since the fight. No, I've been avoiding it." I looked around at the rocks, the hidden cove, the place that had been ours. "It felt wrong to come here without you. Like I'd ruined it."

"You didn't ruin it. We just... took a break." He stood, stretching. "But maybe we can share it again? Alternate schedules if you want privacy, or just coexist in our usual comfortable silence?"

"Coexist sounds good."

The smile he gave me was genuine, reaching his eyes in a way that made him look younger, less defended. "Good. Because I was running out of places to draw without people asking questions."

We walked back toward the main camp together as the dinner bell rang in the distance. Our shoulders bumped occasionally on the narrow path, and neither of us moved away. We didn't talk much, but the silence was comfortable rather than awkward—the silence of people who'd found their way back to each other after almost losing it completely.

At the fork where our paths split toward different cabin areas, Jamie stopped.

"Hey, Palmer?"

"Yeah?"

"What you said during the fight—about my parents. I know you didn't mean it the way it came out. You were just trying to hurt me back because I hurt you first."

"That doesn't make it okay."

"No, but it makes it human." He smiled slightly. "We're even on the terrible things said in anger department. Clean slate?"

I thought about his word—cowardly. About my words about his parents. About hurt traded for hurt, weapons made of vulnerabilities.

"Clean slate," I agreed.

He nodded, then headed toward his cabin, raising a hand in farewell. I watched him go for a moment before turning toward my own cabin, the copy of *To Kill a Mockingbird* still clutched in my hands.

Betty was waiting on the cabin porch, her expression hopeful. "Did you talk to him?"

"Yeah."

"And?"

"And we're okay. We apologized. We're friends again." The words felt insufficient for the complicated tangle of emotions in my chest, but they'd have to do.

"Just friends?" Betty's tone was knowing.

"I don't know," I admitted. "Maybe. Maybe something more. I'm not sure yet."

"Well, figure it out soon," she said, standing to head inside for dinner prep. "Because the way he looks at you isn't the way friends look at each other. And I'm starting to think the way you look at him isn't exactly friendship either."

She left me on the porch with that observation, and I couldn't immediately argue with it.

That night in my bunk, I opened *To Kill a Mockingbird* and found Jamie's note still tucked inside. I read it again in the dim light from the window:

*I'm sorry. I was a jerk about how I said it, even if I wasn't wrong about what I said. You don't have to forgive me, but I miss talking to you.*

Simple words, but they'd been enough to crack open the door I'd thought I'd sealed shut. Enough to start repairing what I'd broken. Enough to make me realize that the friendship I had with Jamie—complicated and messy and sometimes painful—mattered more than the safe fantasy I'd been building around Michael.

I fell asleep with the book on my chest and the note pressed between its pages, thinking about boys who noticed things and boys who didn't, about hiding and being seen, about friendships worth fighting for and fixing.

About how being really known by one person might be scarier than being invisible to everyone, but it was also infinitely better.
