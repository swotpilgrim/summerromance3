# Chapter 11: The Michael Project Continues

Michael mentioned needing help at breakfast, and my hand shot up before my brain could catch up.

"I need someone to help organize the waterfront supply shed this afternoon," he'd said, addressing the whole mess hall but looking at no one in particular. "It's gotten a bit chaotic, and we need everything sorted before the advanced swimming certification next week."

"I can help," I said, my voice carrying across the sudden silence at our table. Betty's head swung toward me so fast I thought she'd hurt her neck.

Michael's eyes found me in the crowd. "Lily, right? That would be great. Meet me at the shed around two?"

"Yes. Two o'clock. I'll be there." I tried to keep my voice steady, professional, like this was just helpful volunteering and not an opportunity I'd been dreaming about.

After he'd moved on to other announcements, Betty leaned close. "The supply shed? Just you and Michael? Alone?"

"It's just organizing equipment."

"Uh-huh." Her expression was knowing, maybe a little concerned. "Just be careful, okay?"

I didn't ask what she meant. I spent the morning in a state of nervous anticipation, practicing conversations in my head. Maybe we'd talk about swimming, and I'd mention how much I'd improved. Maybe he'd ask about my life back home, and I'd have a chance to be interesting, memorable. Maybe this afternoon would be when he finally saw me as more than just another camper.

By the time two o'clock arrived, I'd mentally rehearsed a dozen scenarios, all of them ending with Michael looking at me differently, really seeing me.

The waterfront supply shed was tucked behind the main dock, a weathered wooden structure that smelled of lake water, canvas, and old rope. Michael was already there when I arrived, exactly on time, pulling life jackets from the shelves.

"Thanks for volunteering," he said, giving me that easy smile that made my heart do stupid things. "This has been on my to-do list for weeks. Having an extra pair of hands will make it go so much faster."

"Happy to help." I set down the water bottle I'd brought and looked around. The shed was cramped but not uncomfortably so—close enough that I was aware of Michael's presence, the space he occupied. Life jackets in various sizes hung from hooks or lay in piles. Coiled ropes filled one corner. Wooden paddles leaned against the wall. Kickboards were stacked haphazardly, and swimming equipment cluttered every surface.

"Let's start with the life jackets," Michael suggested. "We need to separate them by size, check for any damage, and get rid of anything that's too worn. Sound good?"

"Sounds good."

We fell into a rhythm—pulling jackets down, checking straps and buckles, sorting by size. Michael talked while we worked, his voice filling the small space with stories about college swimming competitions, about meets where he'd placed well, about his coach who was tough but fair.

"What are you studying?" I asked, seizing the opening for actual conversation. "At college, I mean."

"Physical education. I want to teach, maybe coach at a high school level." He held up a small life jacket, examining a frayed strap. "This one's done. The strap's about to go completely."

"That's nice. Teaching, I mean. You're good with the younger campers."

"Thanks. I like working with kids—helping them overcome fears, build confidence. Like you with swimming. You were terrified that first day, and now look at you. You're doing great."

The compliment warmed me, but there was something about it that felt off. He was encouraging, but in the way a teacher encouraged a student. Professional. Distant. Not the way someone talked to a person they were interested in.

"Do you think you'll come back next summer?" I asked, trying to steer the conversation somewhere more personal. "To Camp Silver Lake, I mean?"

"Maybe. Depends on my course load and whether I can line up a better-paying summer job. Camp is great, but it doesn't pay much." He moved to the rope section, starting to coil loose lines. "What about you? Think you'll come back?"

"I don't know. Maybe."

It was the first time all summer I'd considered that possibility. Two weeks ago, I would have said absolutely not—eight weeks was enough torture. But now, with Jamie and our reading spot and the way camp had started to feel less like exile...

"You should," Michael said. "You've been a big help this summer. Reliable, organized. Those are good qualities."

Reliable. Organized. Good qualities for an employee, maybe. For someone's assistant. Not for someone they saw romantically.

We worked in silence for a while, sorting and organizing. I tried to think of something to say, some question that would make him see me as interesting rather than just helpful. But everything that came to mind felt forced.

The shed door opened, letting in bright afternoon sunlight and Dorothy Hayes.

"Hey, you two!" She held a glass pitcher, condensation beading on the sides. "Thought you might want some lemonade. It's hot in here."

"You're a lifesaver," Michael said, and his whole face changed. The professional pleasantness shifted to something genuinely warm, intimate. He took the pitcher from her hands, their fingers touching in a way that looked practiced, comfortable. "Thanks, Dor."

"No problem. How's it going in here?"

"Great. Lily's been amazing—we're making way better progress than I would have alone." He poured lemonade into the cups Dorothy had brought, handing one to me and keeping one for himself.

I mumbled thanks, feeling suddenly like an intruder. Dorothy leaned against the doorframe, and she and Michael fell into easy conversation about the morning counselor meeting, about someone named Patterson wanting to change the swimming schedule, about whether the lake was too cold for the overnight camping trip next week.

They finished each other's sentences. They referenced shared jokes I didn't understand. Dorothy mentioned something about "that thing we talked about at breakfast," and Michael laughed, clearly knowing exactly what she meant.

I stood there holding my lemonade, watching them exist in their comfortable bubble of shared history and inside jokes. The way Michael looked at Dorothy was different from how he'd looked at me all afternoon—warmer, more focused, more present. Like she was someone who mattered, someone who occupied space in his thoughts beyond the immediate task at hand.

"I should get back to the arts building," Dorothy said finally. "But I wanted to make sure you were staying hydrated. Mrs. Morrison's on a warpath about heat safety."

"Tell her we're being very responsible." Michael's tone was affectionate, teasing in a way I'd never heard him be with anyone else.

"Will do. Bye, Lily! Thanks for helping out."

She left, taking some of the air in the shed with her. Michael watched her go, a small smile on his face that he didn't seem aware of. Then he turned back to me, and the smile shifted to something more professional.

"Where were we? Right, the paddles. Let's check those for splinters and cracks."

We finished the organizing over the next hour. Michael thanked me repeatedly, saying what a help I'd been, how the shed looked better than it had in months. The praise should have felt good. Instead, it felt hollow.

When we finally finished, Michael clapped me on the shoulder—the kind of casual, friendly gesture a coach would give an athlete. "You're the best, Lily. Really appreciate the help."

"Anytime."

"You should head to dinner. I need to lock up here, but I'll see you at the mess hall."

I walked away from the shed, my mind replaying the afternoon in loops. I'd spent hours with Michael, exactly what I'd wanted. We'd talked. He'd complimented me. He'd smiled at me.

But none of it felt the way I'd imagined it would.

~~~

Dinner was the usual chaos—campers comparing plans for the evening, counselors at their separate table, the smell of something that might have been meatloaf mixed with green beans. I filled my tray mechanically, still processing the afternoon.

Betty had saved me a seat, but before I could reach our table, someone slid into the space across from where I'd be sitting.

Jamie.

"Palmer," he greeted me when I arrived. "You look thrilled with life. How'd Operation Golden Boy go?"

I should have been annoyed by his presence, by his immediate reading of my mood, by the knowing look in his eyes. Instead, I felt something loosen in my chest—relief, maybe, at being seen.

"It was fine."

"That sounds incredibly convincing." He took a bite of his meatloaf, made a face. "Seriously, what do they do to the meat to make it taste like this? It's impressive in the worst way."

Betty sat down beside me, giving Jamie a curious look. "I didn't know you were sitting with us tonight."

"I'm not sitting with you. I'm sitting across from Lily, interrogating her about her afternoon." He turned his attention back to me. "So? The shed organizing? The quality time with Michael?"

"I said it was fine."

"You're a terrible liar. What happened?"

I pushed my meatloaf around my plate. "Nothing happened. That's kind of the point. We organized equipment. He talked about college swimming. He thanked me for being helpful. That's it."

"Helpful," Jamie repeated, something almost like sympathy in his voice.

"It's a compliment!"

"It's the kind of compliment you give someone you barely notice." He said it gently, but the words still stung because they were true. "Did he ask you anything personal? About your life, your interests, anything beyond the task you were doing?"

I thought back. "He asked if I'd come back to camp next summer."

"That's a camp-related question. Did he ask about your favorite book? What you want to do after high school? Anything that would show he's curious about who you are?"

The answer was no, and we both knew it. I focused very hard on cutting my green beans into smaller pieces.

Jamie was quiet for a moment. Then he stood, mumbled something about being right back, and disappeared toward the kitchen.

"Is he okay?" Betty asked quietly.

"I think so?"

Jamie returned a few minutes later carrying a small bowl of chocolate pudding—the good dessert, the one that was always gone by the time our table made it through the serving line.

He set it in front of me. "Sparky owed me a favor. Thought you could use this."

I stared at the pudding, something warm and confusing rising in my throat. "How did you—chocolate pudding's my favorite. How did you know that?"

"I pay attention." He said it simply, like it was obvious, like of course he'd noticed what dessert I reached for when I had the choice. "Also, you get this specific expression when they serve it. Very determined. It's kind of adorable."

"I do not."

"You absolutely do. Right, Betty?"

Betty grinned. "Oh, she definitely does. It's her pudding face."

"I don't have a pudding face!"

"You super do," Jamie said. "It's one of your best faces. Top five, easily." He stood again, picking up his tray. "I'll leave you to your pudding face in peace. But Palmer? Stop spending afternoons trying to get Michael to notice you. Trust me on this—you deserve someone who already does."

He walked away before I could respond, leaving me with the chocolate pudding and a confusion of feelings I didn't want to examine.

"He likes you," Betty said quietly. "You know that, right?"

"We're friends."

"Friends don't memorize your pudding preferences and steal dessert from the kitchen to cheer you up." She took a bite of her own dinner. "Friends also don't look at you the way Jamie looks at you when he thinks no one's watching."

"How does he look at me?"

"Like you're the most interesting thing at this camp. Maybe the most interesting thing anywhere." She paused. "I think you look at him the same way, but you haven't figured it out yet."

I ate my chocolate pudding in silence, trying not to think about Jamie's words or the way he'd known exactly what would make me feel better. Trying not to think about how Michael had spent the afternoon talking at me while Jamie spent five minutes actually talking to me.

Trying very hard not to think about which one of those felt more like being seen.

That night in my bunk, I pulled out The Catcher in the Rye—the book Jamie had stolen from Mrs. Morrison's office for me. I ran my fingers over the cover, remembering the note he'd included. *Saw you looking at this during orientation. Borrowed it for you.*

He'd noticed what I wanted from across a crowded mess hall during our first day at camp. He'd remembered for two weeks. He'd gotten it for me.

Michael had spent all afternoon with me and didn't even know my favorite book. Didn't know anything about me beyond that I was reliable and organized.

The realization should have been devastating. Instead, it just felt true.

I opened the book and tried to read, but my mind kept drifting to Jamie sitting across from me at dinner, to the chocolate pudding he'd procured somehow, to his parting words: *You deserve someone who already does.*

Did he mean himself? Was Betty right about the way he looked at me?

I closed the book and stared at the cabin ceiling, listening to the gentle sounds of sleeping girls around me, and tried very hard not to think about how my afternoon with Michael had left me empty while five minutes with Jamie had left me confused and warm and seen.

Tried and failed.
