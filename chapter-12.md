# Chapter 12: Jamie's Uncomfortable Truth

I saw Jamie coming toward me after breakfast and immediately looked for an escape route. The path to the activity buildings was too exposed. The mess hall was emptying, people scattering to morning activities. There was nowhere to go that wouldn't look like obvious avoidance.

He reached me before I could decide on a strategy.

"Palmer, I need to talk to you." No smile, no teasing tone. His expression was serious in a way that made my stomach drop.

"I need to get to swimming—"

"It'll wait." He gestured toward the path that led away from the main camp, toward the quieter section of shoreline. "Please. This is important."

The "please" did it. Jamie didn't say please often.

I followed him down the path, the morning sun already warming the air, cicadas starting their steady hum in the trees. We walked in silence, tension building with each step. I knew what was coming—had known since yesterday's dinner, since his comment about deserving someone who noticed me. I didn't want to hear it. Didn't want him to say out loud what I'd been trying very hard not to acknowledge.

We reached a stretch of shore where the camp buildings weren't visible through the trees. The lake spread before us, calm and blue, indifferent to whatever conversation was about to ruin my morning.

Jamie stopped walking and turned to face me. He ran his hand through his hair—that gesture I'd come to recognize as meaning he was struggling with something.

"Okay," he said. "You're not going to like this."

"Then maybe don't say it."

"I have to. Because we're friends, and friends tell each other the truth even when it sucks." He took a breath. "Michael doesn't see you that way, Lily. He's not going to. He treats you like a kid sister at best—someone helpful and nice, but not someone he'd ever consider romantically. And I know that's hard to hear, but watching you keep hoping for something that won't happen is killing me."

The words hit like I'd been expecting them to, but that didn't make them hurt less. My face burned with humiliation—not just at the rejection but at the fact that my crush was so transparent that Jamie, who'd known me all of three weeks, could read it clearly.

"You don't know that," I said, voice tight. "You don't know what Michael thinks."

"I've been watching, Lily. I see how he is with you versus how he is with Dorothy. I see how he thanked you yesterday for being 'helpful' like you're a good volunteer, not someone he's interested in. I see—"

"Why?" The question came out sharper than I intended. "Why are you watching? Why do you care what I do or who I like or how I spend my summer?"

Jamie looked frustrated, trapped between wanting to say something and not being able to find the words. "Because we're friends now. Friends don't let friends set themselves up for heartbreak."

"Or maybe you just can't stand seeing anyone else happy since you're so miserable."

It was a low blow, and we both knew it. Jamie flinched but didn't back down.

"This isn't about me being miserable. This is about you wasting your summer chasing someone who's never going to look at you the way you want him to. You volunteer for his activities, you show up early, you organize his supply shed—and none of it matters because he doesn't see you."

"You don't know what you're talking about."

"Don't I?" His voice rose slightly, frustration breaking through. "Tell me honestly—yesterday in the shed, did Michael ask you one personal question? Did he try to get to know you at all beyond whether you were useful?"

I opened my mouth to argue and realized I couldn't. Michael hadn't asked me anything personal. He'd talked about himself, accepted my help, and thanked me politely. That was all.

"He's busy," I tried. "He has responsibilities—"

"He has time for Dorothy." Jamie's words were blunt, deliberate. "He makes time to bring her coffee the way she likes it. He laughs at her jokes. He looks at her like she matters. That's what it looks like when someone's interested, Lily. And that's not how he looks at you."

Tears pricked at my eyes, and I hated it. Hated that he was right, hated that I'd been so obvious, hated that we were having this conversation at all.

"Why do you even care?" I asked again, my voice breaking slightly. "Why can't you just let me have this? So what if it's a fantasy? It makes me happy. Or it did until you decided you needed to ruin it."

"Because it's not making you happy!" His hands clenched into fists at his sides. "You're lying to yourself, building up this idea of Michael in your head, and meanwhile you're missing—" He stopped abruptly, jaw tightening.

"Missing what?"

"Everything. You're missing everything real that's happening around you because you're so focused on something that isn't real." He took a breath, visibly trying to calm himself. "You don't even know Michael. If I asked you what his favorite book is, could you tell me? What makes him laugh, what scares him, what he wants beyond the surface stuff he told you while you sorted life jackets?"

"That's not fair—"

"It's completely fair. You're in love with an idea, not a person. And I think—" He paused, struggling with something. "I think you chose him specifically because he's unattainable. Because crushing on a counselor who'd never look at you that way is safe. You can have all the feelings without any of the risk."

The accusation cut deeper than anything else he'd said because somewhere in my chest, I recognized the truth of it.

"You don't know anything about me," I whispered.

"I know you're hiding." His voice softened slightly, but the words still landed hard. "You hide behind books, you hide behind silence, and now you're hiding behind a crush on someone who'll never want you back. It's cowardly, Lily."

The word hung in the air between us, uglier than anything else he'd said. Cowardly. I'd been called shy, quiet, antisocial. Never cowardly.

"How dare you—"

"I dare because someone needs to say it." He looked tired suddenly, the fight draining from him. "You could actually try with Michael if you wanted. Have a real conversation, tell him how you feel, risk actual rejection. Then at least you'd know. But you won't, because that would mean putting yourself out there for real, and it's so much safer to pine from a distance."

"You're cruel," I said, my voice shaking. "You think you're being honest, but you're just cruel."

"Honest and cruel aren't the same thing." His expression was pained now. "Cruel would be letting you keep hoping while I watch you set yourself up for the inevitable hurt. Honest is telling you the truth even though I know it'll make you hate me."

"Why?" I asked again, desperate now. "Why does any of this matter to you so much?"

He opened his mouth, closed it, seemed to wrestle with something. Finally: "Because you deserve better than spending your summer worshiping someone who doesn't even see you. You deserve someone who notices what kind of pudding you like, who remembers the books you want to read, who actually cares what you think about things. You deserve to be seen, Lily, not invisible."

"And you think you see me?" The words came out mocking, defensive.

"I know I do." He said it simply, matter-of-factly. "I've seen you since day one, even when you were trying very hard to be invisible. And yeah, it bothers me watching you waste all that attention on someone who'll never look back."

We stood there, breathing hard, glaring at each other across three feet of morning-lit shore. Birds sang in the trees, oblivious. The lake lapped gently at the rocks. Everything was peaceful except us.

"I hate you," I whispered.

Something flickered across his face—hurt, recognition, maybe both. "Yeah. I'm pretty used to that."

"Why can't you just leave me alone? Why do you have to keep pushing and prodding and—and seeing things I don't want you to see?"

"Because someone should see you." His voice was rough. "Someone should notice when you're lying to yourself and care enough to call you on it. I'm sorry if that hurts. I'm sorry if you hate me for it. But I'm not sorry for telling you the truth."

"The truth," I said bitterly, "is that you're a miserable person who can't stand watching anyone else have something good. You push everyone away—that's why your parents don't want you, that's why you're always in trouble, that's why you have to spend your summers at camp being a problem."

The words were out before I could stop them, sharp and aimed to hurt. Jamie's face went carefully blank—the defensive mask I'd seen him wear before we became friends, before that night on the dock when he'd trusted me with his pain.

"At least I'm not hiding behind a fantasy because I'm too scared to let anyone really know me," he said quietly. "At least when I screw up, it's because I tried something real."

Tears spilled down my cheeks, hot and humiliating. "I hate you."

"You already said that." His voice was flat now, emotionless. "I'll let you get to swimming. Wouldn't want you to miss a chance to be helpful."

He walked away, back toward the main camp, leaving me shaking on the shoreline. I wanted to call him back, wanted to take back the comment about his parents, wanted to rewind the whole conversation and never have it at all.

But I just stood there, crying angry tears, hating him for being right and hating myself for knowing he was right and using his vulnerability as a weapon anyway.

The bell for activities rang in the distance. I wiped my face with the hem of my shirt, trying to compose myself enough to face swimming class. But my hands were shaking and my chest felt tight and I kept replaying Jamie's words.

*You're in love with an idea, not a person.*

*You chose him because he's unattainable. Because it's safe.*

*You deserve someone who notices what kind of pudding you like.*

*I've seen you since day one.*

I walked slowly back toward the main camp, my mind a mess of anger and hurt and the terrible suspicion that Jamie was right about all of it. About Michael, about my hiding, about the safety of a crush that could never become real.

At swimming, Michael greeted me with the same friendly, distant warmth he always did. "Morning, Lily! Ready to work on your backstroke?"

"Yes," I managed, my voice only slightly rough from crying.

He didn't notice. Didn't ask if I was okay, didn't seem to see the evidence of tears on my face. He just launched into the day's lesson, treating me exactly the same as he treated every other camper in the group.

And somewhere, under the hurt and anger and confusion, I felt the first crack in the fantasy I'd been building.

Jamie was right.

Michael didn't see me at all.

The realization sat in my chest like a stone, heavy and undeniable. I went through the motions of swimming class, practicing the strokes Michael demonstrated, trying to focus on technique instead of the complete disaster my morning had become.

But I couldn't stop thinking about Jamie's expression when I'd thrown his parents in his face. The way his defensive mask had snapped back into place, hiding the person I'd gotten to know over the past weeks.

I'd hurt him. Deliberately. Used the vulnerability he'd shared with me as a weapon because he'd told me truths I didn't want to hear.

And the worst part was knowing that even if I apologized, even if I took it back, the damage was done. I'd proven I wasn't safe, wasn't trustworthy with the things that mattered.

I'd become exactly the kind of person who'd hurt him before.

That thought followed me through the rest of the day—through lunch I barely touched, through afternoon activities I went through mechanically, through dinner where I sat with Betty and didn't look toward Jamie's table even once.

That night in my bunk, I replayed the fight over and over, hearing Jamie's words, my words, the terrible way we'd stripped each other down to our worst fears and used them as ammunition.

*You're cowardly.*

*Your parents don't want you.*

Neither of us had won that fight. We'd both just lost something we'd barely started to build.

I pulled out The Catcher in the Rye and tried to read, but all I could think about was the note Jamie had written, the way he'd remembered what I wanted, the way he noticed things about me that Michael never would.

The way I'd thrown it all back in his face because he'd told me truths that hurt.

I closed the book and stared at the ceiling, listening to the other girls' gentle breathing, and tried very hard not to think about how much I'd just lost.

Tried and failed.
