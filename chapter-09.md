# Chapter 9: Moonlight Confessions

I couldn't sleep.

The cabin felt suffocating despite the screen windows and the breeze that should have been cooling. Betty's gentle snoring from the bunk below me, Sandra's occasional sleep-talking, the rustle of someone turning over—all of it pressed against me like weight. I'd been lying there for over an hour, staring at the ceiling, thinking about the scavenger hunt, about Jamie's grin when we won, about how easy it had been to work with him once I stopped fighting it.

About how I'd looked for him at dinner. About how that felt significant in a way I didn't want to examine.

Around midnight, I gave up. Moving carefully so as not to wake Betty, I climbed down from my bunk and grabbed the flashlight from my cubby. I pulled on my cardigan over my nightgown—properly modest, because even though I was sneaking out after lights-out, I wasn't going to risk being indecent.

The cabin door creaked slightly when I opened it, and I froze, waiting to see if anyone stirred. Nothing. I slipped out into the night.

The camp was different in darkness. Familiar paths looked strange in the moonlight, and the sounds were all nocturnal—crickets, the distant hoot of an owl, the ever-present lap of the lake against the shore. I used my flashlight sparingly, just enough to keep from tripping over roots, letting my eyes adjust to the darkness.

I walked without planning where I was going, but my feet knew: the dock. The same dock where Jamie had soaked me and my book over a week ago. The same dock where I'd tried so hard to impress Michael during swimming lessons. It felt safe in a way the hidden rock spot didn't—that place was for daylight, for reading. The dock was for this: nighttime restlessness, thoughts too loud to quiet, the need to be alone with the sky and water.

I reached the end of the dock and sat, legs dangling over the water. The lake stretched before me, dark and vast, reflecting stars and a crescent moon. The breeze was cool against my face, carrying the scent of pine and water. For the first time all day, I felt like I could breathe properly.

I must have sat there for ten minutes, maybe fifteen, before I heard footsteps on the dock.

I should have been surprised. Should have been startled. But somehow, I knew.

"Can't sleep either?" Jamie's voice came from behind me, quiet in the darkness.

"No." I didn't turn around. "How'd you know I was here?"

"Saw your flashlight from the boys' cabins. Figured it was either you or someone planning something stupid, and for once, I wasn't involved in the something stupid, so it had to be you." He sat down beside me, close enough that I could feel the warmth from his arm but not touching. "Mind if I join?"

"Would it matter if I said yes?"

"Probably not." But he said it gently, without his usual edge of teasing.

We sat in silence. After the stifling cabin, after the noise of my own thoughts, the quiet felt good. Comfortable, even. Jamie pulled his knees up and wrapped his arms around them, staring out at the water like he was searching for something in the darkness.

The silence stretched, but this time it wasn't uncomfortable. It was the silence of two people who'd somehow learned they didn't need to fill every moment with words. The crickets sang. The water lapped at the dock posts. Above us, stars scattered across the sky in patterns I didn't know the names for.

"Can I ask you something?" Jamie's voice was soft, almost hesitant—a tone I'd never heard from him before.

"I guess."

"Why do you always have a book?" He turned to look at me. "I don't mean why do you like reading. I mean why do you always need a book with you, like it's armor or something. What are you really hiding from?"

The question hit at something I'd spent sixteen years not examining too closely. I could have deflected, could have given the easy answer about liking stories. But something about the darkness, about the way he'd asked—genuinely curious, not mocking—made me want to tell the truth.

"My parents fight," I said quietly. "Not screaming matches. They're too refined for that. But they have these... cold exchanges. Cutting remarks disguised as concern. Long silences that are worse than yelling. The house is always tense, and I learned early that the best survival strategy was to be invisible. To be so quiet they forgot I was there."

Jamie listened without interrupting, his attention complete and focused in a way that made me continue.

"Books let me disappear somewhere else. Somewhere better. Somewhere I have control." I picked at a splinter on the dock. "When I'm reading, I'm not the girl whose parents clearly regret having a child. I'm not the girl who has nothing interesting to say. I'm just... gone. And that feels safer than being present."

I'd never said it out loud before. Never admitted that my reading wasn't just a hobby but a survival mechanism. The vulnerability felt terrifying and somehow liberating at the same time.

"That's why you came to camp already planning to hide," Jamie said. It wasn't a question.

"Yes. Eight weeks felt like a prison sentence. But I figured if I had to be here, at least I could find corners to disappear into. Places to read and wait it out."

"Until you could go back home to more disappearing."

"Yes." The word came out small.

Jamie was quiet for a long moment. Then: "My parents divorced two years ago."

I looked at him, surprised by the shift, but his gaze stayed on the water.

"It was brutal. Public and ugly and the kind of thing people gossiped about at the country club. Dad left Mom for his secretary—classic, right? Mom didn't take it well. She met someone new six months later and basically erased Dad from existence." His voice was flat, reciting facts. "Problem is, I'm half Dad. So where does that leave me?"

"Jamie—"

"Dad has a new apartment with his new wife. It's small, modern, lots of glass and chrome. There's no room for me—literally no room. They have a guest bedroom that doubles as his office, and when I visit, I sleep on a pullout couch that he complains about replacing because I'm only there twice a month anyway." He laughed, but it wasn't his usual laugh. It was bitter. "Mom remarried last year. Steve's nice enough. His kids are younger than me, and they all fit together like a real family. I'm the leftover from her previous life, the reminder of the embarrassing divorce."

I didn't know what to say. Every response felt inadequate.

"They send me to camp because neither of them wants to deal with me during summer. Dad's traveling for work—or that's the excuse. Mom and Steve are taking 'the family' to Europe." He made air quotes around 'the family.' "And I'm the problem that gets solved by eight weeks at Camp Silver Lake."

"That's not fair." The words came out fierce, surprising me. "You're not a problem to be solved."

"Tell them that." He pulled his knees tighter against his chest, making himself smaller. "I started the pranks the first summer after the divorce. I figured if everyone was going to think I was a problem anyway, I might as well act like one. At least then I controlled how people saw me. At least then I was noticed, even if it was for the wrong reasons."

Understanding clicked into place. "You test people."

"Yeah." He glanced at me. "I act out and see who bothers to look deeper. Usually, no one does. They just see the troublemaker and write me off. It's easier that way—for everyone."

"That's why you keep drawing attention to yourself. Why you can't just be quiet and invisible like me."

"Being invisible feels like dying." He said it simply. "I watched my parents make me invisible—erased me from their new lives because I didn't fit the picture they wanted. So I make noise. I make trouble. I make people see me, even if what they see isn't great."

We sat with that revelation, the truth of it hanging in the air between us. We'd approached the same problem from opposite directions—I made myself invisible to survive, he made himself impossible to ignore. Both of us hiding, just in different ways.

"Your book thing," Jamie said slowly, working through the thought. "And my prank thing. We're doing the same thing."

"Protecting ourselves."

"From being seen as we actually are." He turned to face me fully. "Because if people really looked at you, they might see that you're not worth knowing. And if people really looked at me, they might see that my own parents didn't want me, so why would anyone else?"

The words hurt to hear because I recognized the fear underneath. It was my fear too—that being truly visible would lead to rejection. Better to hide, or to control how you're seen, than to risk someone looking at the real you and walking away.

"I think you're worth knowing," I said quietly.

Jamie looked surprised, then something softer. "Yeah?"

"You're annoying and too loud and you can't leave me alone." The words came out gentle rather than harsh. "But you notice things. You see people. You saw me when I was trying very hard to be invisible. And you draw beautiful things, and you climb trees to help find pine cones, and you apologize when you're wrong. That's worth knowing."

"Palmer." His voice was rough. "That might be the nicest thing anyone's said to me in two years."

"Well, don't get used to it."

He laughed, and this time it was his real laugh, warm and genuine. "There's the girl I know."

"I think you're worth knowing too," I added, the truth surprising me even as I said it. "Annoying, but worth it."

"I'll take it."

We fell back into silence, but everything felt different now. We'd told each other true things, scary things, the kind of things you don't share with people you're just passing time with. The vulnerability should have felt terrifying, but instead, it felt like relief.

Like I'd been holding my breath for sixteen years and finally exhaled.

"So," Jamie said eventually, "we're both hiding from being known. Using books and pranks like shields. Running away from the same fear in opposite directions."

"Apparently."

"That's either the saddest thing I've ever heard or the beginning of a pretty good friendship."

I thought about that. About the past week—the frustration and arguments, but also the shared rock spot, the scavenger hunt victory, this conversation on the dock in darkness. About how Jamie had seen through my invisibility act from day one and hadn't let me hide.

"Maybe both," I said.

"I can work with both." He bumped his shoulder against mine gently. "Thanks for telling me. About your parents and the books and the hiding. I know that wasn't easy."

"Thanks for telling me too. About your parents and the pranks and the testing."

We sat there a while longer, watching stars reflect on the water, comfortable in the shared knowledge of each other's truths. Eventually, the cold started to seep through my cardigan, and Jamie noticed me shiver.

"We should head back before someone does cabin checks and realizes we're missing."

"Yeah."

We stood, brushing off our clothes. The walk back to the cabins felt different than the walk here—less lonely, less heavy. Jamie walked beside me, close enough that our arms brushed occasionally, and neither of us moved away.

At the fork where the path split toward boys' and girls' cabins, we stopped.

"See you tomorrow, Palmer."

"See you tomorrow, Sullivan."

He grinned at the use of his last name, then headed toward the boys' side. I watched him go for a moment before turning toward my cabin. I climbed back into my bunk carefully, hoping Betty hadn't woken up and noticed my absence.

But as I lay there, staring at the ceiling again, my thoughts had quieted. The restlessness that had driven me from the cabin had settled into something calmer. I'd told someone the truth about why I hid, and he hadn't used it against me. He'd shared his own truth in return, and I hadn't judged him for it.

We'd seen each other—really seen each other—and neither of us had walked away.

That felt like something precious. Something worth protecting.

I reached for The Secret Garden out of habit, but I didn't open it. Instead, I just held it, thinking about Mary and Colin and Dickon in their hidden garden, how they'd helped each other come back to life.

Maybe that's what friends did. Maybe that's what Jamie was becoming, despite my best efforts to keep everyone at a distance.

Maybe being truly known by one person was less terrifying than being invisible to everyone.

The thought followed me into sleep, where I dreamed of stars on water and someone who saw me anyway.
